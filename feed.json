It looked amazing, relaxed and comfortable. We booked it, and a couple of emails were sent back and forth, setting up a transfer from the dock and other smaller things.

I can now use footnotes on all the posts[^kec]! \n\nAlso installed [Open Graph Cards](https://github.com/thatguygriff/plugin-open-graph), by [@thatguygriff](https://micro.blog/thatguygriff) and now my posts on Mastodon look much nicer. \n\nBonus: If you're a Drafts user[^jke], you can add [Footnote 2](https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1QT) to your Markdown keyboard, and including footnotes is a breeze.\n\n\n[^kji]: I really do!\n[^bpo]: I really am!\n[^h2y]: Small things, very small...\n[^jl4]: Duh!\n[^kec]: Promise I won’t, don’t worry!\n[^jke]: And you should...\n",

Luang Prabang was not an instant hit with us.</p>\n\n<p>Our new hotel, thankfully, was a lot nicer, and the staff made it even better. We couldn’t have found a cosier place.

That&rsquo;s when it hit me, and I started frantically looking at her hands and feet, making sure everything was ok. Were the eyes ok ? How about the nose ? Her mouth ? The paediatrician said everything was ok, but I had to check for myself.</p>\n\n<p><strong>That clock had started ticking, there&rsquo;s no stopping that now</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>We spent three days there, in our room, getting busy with an array of doctors, nurses and auxiliary staff, all taking care of us and the baby, teaching us the basics of newborn care. We&rsquo;d done a workshop during the pregnancy, but that fake baby died a couple of times in our hands. No place for those mistakes now&hellip;</p>\n\n<p>As everything was ok by day three, first vaccine already taken and all the tests we could wish for, so we were let go. <strong>It was one of the scariest moments of my life</strong>, and I&rsquo;ve been through a few scary things.\nGetting dressed, packing our bags, and leaving to get the car, that&rsquo;s when it dawned on me, again: she&rsquo;s our responsibility. Forever. No taking that back. We have to take care of her, on our own, for the rest of our lives.</p>\n\n<p>I spoke with other dads, and the feeling was the same for them. For nine months, you get you&rsquo;re about to become a dad. You see your wife getting bigger, shopping for the baby, getting the house ready,&hellip; But when she&rsquo;s born, that&rsquo;s when you really, really, get it! No amount of preparation gets us ready for <strong>that</strong> moment!</p>\n\n<p>We came home to our in-laws, where we had already spent the last month and a half of the pregnancy, lockdown from corona virus. We have a ton of support here, so that&rsquo;s easier on us. Help with cooking, help with laundry, help with shopping, help with caring. Plenty of help. More than most people have, and that&rsquo;s a blessing.</p>\n\n<p>All in all, it hasn&rsquo;t been as hard as some people we know that we know and had babies recently made us believe it would be. Every baby is a different baby, they told us, and some are harder, they said. I guess. Clara is pretty mellow, and we expected a heavier load, truth be told.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s hard to go from doing whatever you want, whenever you want, to having your whole schedule dictated by the baby&rsquo;s needs, but we&rsquo;re getting there, no big issues. That&rsquo;s what we signed up for.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s soooo cool to look at her and notice the way she&rsquo;s changing, slowly, day by day. The way she couldn&rsquo;t see properly on the first days and now she looks at you and it seems she already recognise us. Every thing about her is coated in extra sweetness. The way she moves her arms, the way she makes tiny fists and shakes them about when she&rsquo;s waking up, the surprised look when we&rsquo;re changing her diaper&hellip;</p>\n\n<p>Changing diapers is my new thing, by the way, so far it&rsquo;s not heavy duty. And I love bath days and they way she loves the warm water.</p>\n\n<p>Sleeping has been an issue though, we have a night owl with us. She loves sleeping in but, as soon as night falls, she&rsquo;s awake. When she does fall asleep, the scary noises start, and I&rsquo;m wide awake by then, afraid something will happen and I won&rsquo;t notice! When I do sleep is because I&rsquo;m completely exhausted and just fall down.</p>\n\n<p>But that&rsquo;s it. She doesn&rsquo;t even cry that much, she&rsquo;s as sweet as babies come, and the most beautiful one I&rsquo;ve seen. I know, I know, I shouldn&rsquo;t be the one saying this, but she is.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m double lucky to have all of this with my wife, my movieStar. We&rsquo;ve had an amazing time before the baby was born, a wedding that was a dream, the most amazing honeymoon imaginable, and everything that led up to this moment has been an absolute pleasure. She is, simply, the best!</p>\n\n<p>Long live movieStar, and long live tinyMovieStar! ❤️</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2020/ffa2622f40.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"399\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n",

The way she moves her arms, the way she makes tiny fists and shakes them about when she's waking up, the surprised look when we're changing her diaper...\r\n\r\nChanging diapers is my new thing, by the way, so far it's not heavy duty. And I love bath days and they way she loves the warm water.\r\n\r\nSleeping has been an issue though, we have a night owl with us. She loves sleeping in but, as soon as night falls, she's awake. When she does fall asleep, the scary noises start, and I'm wide awake by then, afraid something will happen and I won't notice! When I do sleep is because I'm completely exhausted and just fall down.  \r\n\r\nBut that's it. She doesn't even cry that much, she's as sweet as babies come, and the most beautiful one I've seen. I know, I know, I shouldn't be the one saying this, but she is.\r\n\r\nI'm double lucky to have all of this with my wife, my movieStar. We've had an amazing time before the baby was born, a wedding that was a dream, the most amazing honeymoon imaginable, and everything that led up to this moment has been an absolute pleasure. She is, simply, the best!  \r\n\r\nLong live movieStar, and long live tinyMovieStar! ❤️\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2020/ffa2622f40.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"399\" alt=\"\" />\n",

				"title": "Drafts",
				"content_html": "\n\n<h2 id=\"drafts-again-maybe-forever\">Drafts, again, maybe forever ?</h2>\n\n<p>A couple of weeks ago I got back into the <a href=\"https://getdrafts.com\">Drafts</a> train. I&rsquo;d been a user, on and off, for years, but always found myself stepping off and using other apps for my note taking. I&rsquo;ve used the usual suspects, Notes.app, Bear, &hellip;</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/f77e91d678.jpg\" alt=\"ready\" /></p>\n\n<p>This time around, locked in a hospital room, waiting for my first child (baby girl, thank you very much), I had time to start digging in, and try to find other uses for it. And I did. Turns out I found a few.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"pro-subscription\">Pro subscription</h3>\n\n<p>First thing I did was find an excuse to subscribe to the <a href=\"https://docs.getdrafts.com/draftspro\">Pro tier</a>. An icon sealed that deal. I NEEDED that classic Mac icon!</p>\n\n<p>Soon I found myself using other Pro features: Themes, Workspaces (amazing) and editing actions to better suit me. But I didn&rsquo;t have to. I wouldn&rsquo;t really need these.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/e898206777.jpg\" alt=\"workspaces\" /></p>\n\n<p>Supporting development is the main reason you should pay, even though the app feels Pro on the free tier. It does a LOT without the extra features. Most actions don&rsquo;t need editing to work for you, workspaces are really nice to have, but only needed if you find yourself using it all day, for everything (by then you should be paying something anyway), and the theme selection is still far from perfect (Nord theme maybe coming ??).</p>\n\n<p>Moving on, what am I using it for ?</p>\n\n<p>A few of the things that now live on my Drafts:</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"notes-duh\">Notes. Duh.</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Note taking</strong>, let&rsquo;s get this one out of the way first.\nI love taking notes, small bits all day long; and I love doing it in <a href=\"https://larsenwork.com/monoid/\">Monoid</a>. Turns out Drafts is really good for note taking and you can pick from one of the included fonts, or install your own.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Clarinha Diary</strong>: write something down real quick about the baby, press a button, it gets added to a running note, complete with date and time. When the day ends, I just paste that note into Day One, where a more complete journal is being written, with photos.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"get-your-tweet-on\">Get your Tweet on!</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Twitter</strong>! I found out I love to tweet from Drafts, and I&rsquo;m not talking about an action to send the draft to <a href=\"https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/\">Tweetbot</a>. Just using plain old simple Twitter, from inside Drafts. The tweet gets published and I&rsquo;m not spending another minute, or hour, going down my timeline.\nYou can, of course, use Drafts to send your text to Tweetbot, or Twitterrific, but this is the one working for me.</p>\n\n<p>Actions:<br />\n| <a href=\"https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1E5\">Tweet</a><br />\n| <a href=\"https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1CT\">Tweet with Tweetbot</a><br />\n| <a href=\"https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1CU\">Tweet with Twitterrific</a></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"out-shopping\">Out Shopping</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Shopping List</strong>. I&rsquo;m a big <a href=\"https://culturedcode.com/things/\">Things</a> fan, and use it for all my task needs. I have dozens of personal and professional projects going on, all neatly organised in Things.</p>\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s where my shopping list also lives. That was pre-Covid, when I could freely unlock my phone when out in the supermarket. Not anymore. Wearing a mask makes this an excruciatingly hard exercise, and I found myself thinking there had to be a better way. Turns out it does.</p>\n\n<p>Drafts to the rescue. The shopping mode keeps the screen on the whole time, and the keyboard is disabled. I can get my phone in and out of my pocket as many times as I wish, it&rsquo;s always on. Perfect.</p>\n\n<p>Action:<br />\n| <a href=\"https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1OR\">Toggle Shopping Mode</a></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"scheduling-stuff\">Scheduling stuff</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Calendar</strong>. Inputting stuff into <a href=\"https://flexibits.com/fantastical\">Fantastical</a>. It now feels weird to go into Fantastical to add an event, even though that&rsquo;s also an easy task. But I&rsquo;m so used to opening Drafts when I unlock my phone, I&rsquo;ll just write it down and add it to Fantastical from there. Even nicer when I have multiple events to add. You&rsquo;ll see.</p>\n\n<p>Actions:<br />\n| <a href=\"https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1CM\">Event in Fantastical</a><br />\n| <a href=\"https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1ED\">Events in Fantastical</a><br />\n| <a href=\"https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1Lk\">Fantastically Good Event Parser</a></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"tasks-galore\">Tasks galore</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Tasks</strong>. Same workflow for Things. Drafts is now the place where I write down what i need to do, and then these tasks are sent to Things.</p>\n\n<p>Action:<br />\n| <a href=\"https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1CO\">Task in Things</a></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"email-that-for-me-will-you\">Email that for me, will you?</h3>\n\n<p>Writing Rich Text emails in Markdown and sending them on their way with <a href=\"https://sparkmailapp.com\">Spark</a>. Easier to format text this way.</p>\n\n<p>Actions:<br />\n| <a href=\"https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1J3\">Email (Spark)</a><br />\n| <a href=\"https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1JR\">Email - Spark (Markdown)</a></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"are-you-talking-to-me\">Are you talking to me?</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Messaging</strong>. <a href=\"https://telegram.org\">Telegram</a>/<a href=\"https://www.whatsapp.com\">WhatsApp</a>. For quick replies I&rsquo;ll go into these apps and write on the appropriate chat. If I&rsquo;m preparing a longer text, I find it more convenient to write it down on Drafts.\nThat&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve found very comfortable for a lot of apps: writing down stuff away from the app where it&rsquo;ll end up. It&rsquo;s easier for me to focus on the thing I&rsquo;m writing if it&rsquo;s just a black screen with no distractions from the app.<br />\nThe Telegram action wasn&rsquo;t available and it was well within my level of expertise to make one, so I did.</p>\n\n<p>Actions:<br />\n| <a href=\"https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/18E\">Send to Telegram</a><br />\n| <a href=\"https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1HN\">Send to WhatsApp</a></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"extra-things\">Extra things</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"you-can-quote-me-on-that\">You can quote me on that</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Quote repository</strong>. Workspaces are great for this. They keep my inbox clean, and make it easy to find stuff when I need it. Tag support is great on Drafts, if you tag your notes, it&rsquo;s super easy to have them automatically organised in Workspaces.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"snip-snip\">Snip snip</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Snippet vault</strong>. Same goes for snippets. <a href=\"https://tot.rocks\">Tot</a> is a great app for snippets with a short expiration date, Drafts is used to keep the ones that&rsquo;ll live longer, like hashtag bundles for Instagram&hellip;</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"my-wife-is-a-hoot\">My Wife is a hoot</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Wife Sleepy Craziness</strong>. My wife sometimes says the craziest things while sleeping. Some of the most hilarious sentences I&rsquo;ve heard. This is where they live.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"meta-action\">Meta action.</h3>\n\n<p>One of the things I felt I needed when writing, is a notes file for the note I&rsquo;m writing. I know, I know&hellip;.\nObviously someone had thought about that already (thanks, @agiletortoise, again) and I can now press a button and go back and forth between the note I&rsquo;m writing and the notes for that note. Helpful as hell.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/4dbe334d70.jpg\" alt=\"meta\" /></p>\n\n<p>Action:<br />\n| <a href=\"https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/17w\">Meta Data &lt; &gt; Draft</a></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"github-gist\">GitHub Gist</h3>\n\n<p>Even though I&rsquo;m not a developer, I like to use <a href=\"https://github.com\">GitHub</a>. I host this blog on <a href=\"https://pages.github.com\">GitHub Pages</a> and I use <a href=\"https://gist.github.com\">GitHub Gist</a> to share stuff with friends. I make small travel guides with tips for my friends, and post them there, or small tutorials when another friend needs help with something and I feel I can help.\nI used Sublime Text to compose these, and then upload them to Gist. There had to be a way to do this with Drafts, so why not change my workflow?\nTurns out the action to do that was outdated, not working. A quick trip to the <a href=\"https://forums.getdrafts.com\">forum</a>, and @agiletortoise came through, yet again, updating the action in no time. Isn&rsquo;t that the greatest customer support ever?</p>\n\n<p>Action:<br />\n| <a href=\"https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/18O\">Post Gist to Github</a></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"edit-09-05-2020\">Edit 09-05-2020</h2>\n\n<p>I forgot a couple of things, so I&rsquo;ll just add them here. More coming in the future, I&rsquo;m sure, as this app is so cool it feels like having a new phone, and I keep finding new stuff I can get accomplished with it.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"blogging-still\">Blogging, still</h3>\n\n<p>One of the things I do, on and off (mostly off these days) is blogging.

				"content_text": "\n## Drafts, again, maybe forever ?\n\nA couple of weeks ago I got back into the [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com) train. I'd been a user, on and off, for years, but always found myself stepping off and using other apps for my note taking. I've used the usual suspects, Notes.app, Bear, ...\n\n![ready](https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/f77e91d678.jpg)\n\nThis time around, locked in a hospital room, waiting for my first child (baby girl, thank you very much), I had time to start digging in, and try to find other uses for it. And I did. Turns out I found a few. \n\n### Pro subscription \nFirst thing I did was find an excuse to subscribe to the [Pro tier](https://docs.getdrafts.com/draftspro). An icon sealed that deal. I NEEDED that classic Mac icon!\n\nSoon I found myself using other Pro features: Themes, Workspaces (amazing) and editing actions to better suit me. But I didn't have to. I wouldn't really need these. \n\n![workspaces](https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/e898206777.jpg)\n\nSupporting development is the main reason you should pay, even though the app feels Pro on the free tier. It does a LOT without the extra features. Most actions don't need editing to work for you, workspaces are really nice to have, but only needed if you find yourself using it all day, for everything (by then you should be paying something anyway), and the theme selection is still far from perfect (Nord theme maybe coming ??). \n\nMoving on, what am I using it for ? \n\nA few of the things that now live on my Drafts:\n\n### Notes. Duh. \n**Note taking**, let's get this one out of the way first. \nI love taking notes, small bits all day long; and I love doing it in [Monoid](https://larsenwork.com/monoid/). Turns out Drafts is really good for note taking and you can pick from one of the included fonts, or install your own.\n\n**Clarinha Diary**: write something down real quick about the baby, press a button, it gets added to a running note, complete with date and time. When the day ends, I just paste that note into Day One, where a more complete journal is being written, with photos.\n\n### Get your Tweet on!\n**Twitter**! I found out I love to tweet from Drafts, and I'm not talking about an action to send the draft to [Tweetbot](https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/). Just using plain old simple Twitter, from inside Drafts. The tweet gets published and I'm not spending another minute, or hour, going down my timeline. \nYou can, of course, use Drafts to send your text to Tweetbot, or Twitterrific, but this is the one working for me.\n\nActions:  \n| [Tweet](https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1E5)  \n| [Tweet with Tweetbot](https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1CT)  \n| [Tweet with Twitterrific](https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1CU)  \n\n### Out Shopping \n**Shopping List**. I'm a big [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/) fan, and use it for all my task needs. I have dozens of personal and professional projects going on, all neatly organised in Things. \n\nThat's where my shopping list also lives. That was pre-Covid, when I could freely unlock my phone when out in the supermarket. Not anymore. Wearing a mask makes this an excruciatingly hard exercise, and I found myself thinking there had to be a better way. Turns out it does.\n\nDrafts to the rescue. The shopping mode keeps the screen on the whole time, and the keyboard is disabled. I can get my phone in and out of my pocket as many times as I wish, it's always on. Perfect.\n\nAction:  \n| [Toggle Shopping Mode](https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1OR)  \n\n### Scheduling stuff\n**Calendar**. Inputting stuff into [Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical). It now feels weird to go into Fantastical to add an event, even though that's also an easy task. But I'm so used to opening Drafts when I unlock my phone, I'll just write it down and add it to Fantastical from there. Even nicer when I have multiple events to add. You'll see. \n\nActions:  \n| [Event in Fantastical](https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1CM)  \n| [Events in Fantastical](https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1ED)  \n| [Fantastically Good Event Parser](https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1Lk)  \n\n### Tasks galore\n**Tasks**. Same workflow for Things. Drafts is now the place where I write down what i need to do, and then these tasks are sent to Things. \n\nAction:  \n| [Task in Things](https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1CO)  \n\n### Email that for me, will you?\nWriting Rich Text emails in Markdown and sending them on their way with [Spark](https://sparkmailapp.com). Easier to format text this way. \n\nActions:  \n| [Email (Spark)](https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1J3)  \n| [Email - Spark (Markdown)](https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1JR)  \n\n### Are you talking to me?\n**Messaging**. [Telegram](https://telegram.org)/[WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com). For quick replies I'll go into these apps and write on the appropriate chat. If I'm preparing a longer text, I find it more convenient to write it down on Drafts. \nThat's something I've found very comfortable for a lot of apps: writing down stuff away from the app where it'll end up. It's easier for me to focus on the thing I'm writing if it's just a black screen with no distractions from the app.  \nThe Telegram action wasn't available and it was well within my level of expertise to make one, so I did.\n\nActions:  \n| [Send to Telegram](https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/18E)  \n| [Send to WhatsApp](https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1HN)  \n\n## Extra things\n\n### You can quote me on that \n**Quote repository**. Workspaces are great for this. They keep my inbox clean, and make it easy to find stuff when I need it. Tag support is great on Drafts, if you tag your notes, it's super easy to have them automatically organised in Workspaces.\n\n### Snip snip\n**Snippet vault**. Same goes for snippets. [Tot](https://tot.rocks) is a great app for snippets with a short expiration date, Drafts is used to keep the ones that'll live longer, like hashtag bundles for Instagram...\n\n### My Wife is a hoot\n**Wife Sleepy Craziness**. My wife sometimes says the craziest things while sleeping. Some of the most hilarious sentences I've heard. This is where they live. \n\n### Meta action. \nOne of the things I felt I needed when writing, is a notes file for the note I'm writing. I know, I know....\nObviously someone had thought about that already (thanks, @agiletortoise, again) and I can now press a button and go back and forth between the note I'm writing and the notes for that note. Helpful as hell. \n\n![meta](https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/4dbe334d70.jpg)\n\nAction:  \n| [Meta Data < > Draft](https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/17w)  \n\n### GitHub Gist\n\nEven though I'm not a developer, I like to use [GitHub](https://github.com). I host this blog on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) and I use [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com) to share stuff with friends. I make small travel guides with tips for my friends, and post them there, or small tutorials when another friend needs help with something and I feel I can help.\nI used Sublime Text to compose these, and then upload them to Gist. There had to be a way to do this with Drafts, so why not change my workflow?\nTurns out the action to do that was outdated, not working. A quick trip to the [forum](https://forums.getdrafts.com), and @agiletortoise came through, yet again, updating the action in no time. Isn't that the greatest customer support ever?\n\nAction:  \n| [Post Gist to Github](https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/18O)  \n\n## Edit 09-05-2020   \nI forgot a couple of things, so I'll just add them here. More coming in the future, I'm sure, as this app is so cool it feels like having a new phone, and I keep finding new stuff I can get accomplished with it.\n\n### Blogging, still\n\nOne of the things I do, on and off (mostly off these days) is blogging. Sometimes I write down something and post it, that's it. It's mainly for myself, my readership levels should not even make it to two digits, but I like to do it, from time to time. \n\n![blog](https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/d4bc47a683.jpg)\n\nLonger posts go into a [Medium publication](https://medium.com/making-of-maiquemadeira) that lies dormant most of the year, and other stuff I publish on this [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) install hosted on GitHub Pages. It was set up mainly as a proof-of-concept, when I was looking for ways to use GitHub as a non-developer, and I remember I have it here, ready to post, from time to time.\n\n### Can you hear me?\n\nDictation is not the first thing that comes to mind when I'm writing, but maybe it should!\n\n![dict](https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/b3d8922127.jpg)\n\nI never got into the habit of talking to my iPhone, but Drafts does that really well. I started getting into it now that one of my hands is usually holding a baby, and I'm forced to write with the other one. The size of the iPhone is not well suited for that, so I started using this feature more often. Press a button on the extra keyboard row, say a few things, and most of it is usually write. A few tweaks and it's ready to go.  \n\nI can keep on talking for as long as I want to, it never goes into sleep mode, and I can do it in English and Portuguese. Maybe I'll even stop hating the way my voice sounds!\n\n### Note\n\nMost actions I've posted are the _official_ ones, made by [@agiletortoise](http://twitter.com/agiletortoise). There are countless variations, some with a huge amount of extra features. You should try them out if you feel you need something more than the stock features.\nMost of them are already included on the action groups that are installed by default, so you don't even need to download them, unless you've deleted them in the meantime.\n\nBrowse the [Drafts Directory](https://actions.getdrafts.com) and I'm sure you'll find dozens that fit your needs.\n\nTry it.

One by one we were called to the squad car, to deal with the fine payment. 400 dirhams, that was the sum we’d have to fork over. When my time arrived, I took the money from my pocket and handed it over to the agent, sitting on his car. The moroccan drivers already left the scene. As the agent picked up the receipt book, he spoke… ‘Expensive ?’ Hmmm, I thought, the door has been opened for ‘negotiation’. ‘Yes, very expensive’ I replied, waiting for the alternative sum. It was not my first dance with the local police, and ready to dance I was. He just looked at me, kindly warned me to be a little more careful next time, and handed over the money. All of it. All. I almost felt like kissing him, but instead got into the car and drove away.

One by one we were called to the squad car, to deal with the fine payment. 400 dirhams, that was the sum we’d have to fork over. When my time arrived, I took the money from my pocket and handed it over to the agent, sitting on his car. The moroccan drivers already left the scene. As the agent picked up the receipt book, he spoke… ‘Expensive ?’ Hmmm, I thought, the door has been opened for ‘negotiation’. ‘Yes, very expensive’ I replied, waiting for the alternative sum. It was not my first dance with the local police, and ready to dance I was. He just looked at me, kindly warned me to be a little more careful next time, and handed over the money. All of it. All.

My job. I’d been working there for close to twenty years.</p>\n<h4 name=\"3770\" id=\"3770\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">01. Before</h4>\n<p name=\"fb61\" id=\"fb61\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Growing up I can remember wanting to be a Systems Engineer. That’s where my studies were leading to. Things didn’t turn out that way (another blog post, maybe?) and, as I discovered photography, I knew I’d found a new goal in life.</p>\n<p name=\"95e8\" id=\"95e8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">My mind made up, I went to <a href=\"http://arco.pt/site/\" data-href=\"http://arco.pt/site/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">photo school</a>. The student body at the time was made up of mostly two groups: the artist wannabes and the photojournalist wannabes. I quickly joined the photojournalism group, as they seemed the most fun to be around, and soon enough I also knew where I wanted to work when school was done: the job I just left.</p>\n<p name=\"a6f6\" id=\"a6f6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Went through photo school, tried to find an internship at the <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">dream place</em>, failed to do that, ended up doing my internship (7 months, no pay) at another newspaper (the competition). It was not the best of times, but I learned a lot there, met a ton of people who would play important roles for years to come, worked my butt off, made Staff Photographer, and waited until someone responsible at the dream paper noticed my work.</p>\n<h4 name=\"1ad2\" id=\"1ad2\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">02. During</h4>\n<p name=\"45f2\" id=\"45f2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">At the time there were a lot of magazines and newspapers around, and new ones popped up every once in a while. People moved from place to place with relative ease, and three years later an opportunity presented itself: there was a new paper in town, and a couple of photographers were leaving the dream place and moving there. I, it turned out, was considered for a position by the new editor. I, it turned out, moved to the dream place after three years at my first paper. I was 27 years old, there was no other place on earth I’d rather be. There was also no other place to go. This was it.</p>\n<p name=\"0f51\" id=\"0f51\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The Photo Desk at this newspaper was epic, all of them masters of the trade. They were always covering stories most photographers in the country could only dream about, there was always money around to go on cool assignments. We were much bigger than our country, where no one seems to read a newspaper unless it a crappy one, or a sports paper.</p>\n<p name=\"dcbe\" id=\"dcbe\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">A few months went by and I was sent on assignment to Kosovo! Kosovo! I’d gotten as far as Madrid on the other paper! A year later I would be developing film in a bathroom in East-Timor. The following nineteen years would be a roller coaster ride, as they say, with a lot of good stories, a ton of good friends, everything I could have wished for. My dream life was coming true, every single day.</p>\n<p name=\"d3f4\" id=\"d3f4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This is the place where I would grow, as a person and as a photographer. I wouldn’t be the same one if I’d spent the last twenty years somewhere else.</p>\n<p name=\"e0e4\" id=\"e0e4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">And where did I find myself after those twenty years ? Stuck to a desk most of the year, editor for longer than I can remember, spending most of my days looking at other people’s photos instead of my own. I was not as happy as I could be, that’s for sure. I would still get the occasional assignment, but those were far apart and had been getting shorter for a while now. Things have also been different for a while now, even at the dream place.</p>\n<h4 name=\"5d8b\" id=\"5d8b\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">03. After</h4>\n<p name=\"0854\" id=\"0854\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Close to the end of last year we were told by the management that some more cuts would have to be made. We’d been here before, sadly a few times over the years. It’s not a good place to be. This time around a generous severance package was being offered to those who would volunteer. I volunteered.</p>\n<p name=\"1ad6\" id=\"1ad6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I now find myself in the freelancing position. As I will surely have a lot of extra time on my hands (<a href=\"https://medium.com/@maique/no-country-for-freelancers-49c7c221f850#.5dy8etnw8\" data-href=\"https://medium.com/@maique/no-country-for-freelancers-49c7c221f850#.5dy8etnw8\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" target=\"_blank\">No Country For Freelancers</a>), I thought about blogging again. I will try to keep things separate, the extra geekiness contained at <a href=\"https://guezota.com/\" data-href=\"https://guezota.com/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Guezota Diaries</a> and the day-to-day life of the unemployed photographer at <a href=\"https://chevalierdubois.com/\" data-href=\"https://chevalierdubois.com/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Chevalier du Bois</a>. I plan to share stories about the projects I’ll hopefully get off the ground, as well as stuff about the twenty-something years it took me to get here. These were really cool times, going from film to digital and from paper to online, and I was lucky to be able to live them.

It was not the best of times, but I learned a lot there, met a ton of people who would play important roles for years to come, worked my butt off, made Staff Photographer, and waited until someone responsible at the dream paper noticed my work.</p>\n<h4 name=\"1ad2\" id=\"1ad2\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">02. During</h4>\n<p name=\"45f2\" id=\"45f2\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">At the time there were a lot of magazines and newspapers around, and new ones popped up every once in a while. People moved from place to place with relative ease, and three years later an opportunity presented itself: there was a new paper in town, and a couple of photographers were leaving the dream place and moving there. I, it turned out, was considered for a position by the new editor. I, it turned out, moved to the dream place after three years at my first paper. I was 27 years old, there was no other place on earth I’d rather be. There was also no other place to go. This was it.</p>\n<p name=\"0f51\" id=\"0f51\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The Photo Desk at this newspaper was epic, all of them masters of the trade. They were always covering stories most photographers in the country could only dream about, there was always money around to go on cool assignments. We were much bigger than our country, where no one seems to read a newspaper unless it a crappy one, or a sports paper.</p>\n<p name=\"dcbe\" id=\"dcbe\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">A few months went by and I was sent on assignment to Kosovo! Kosovo! I’d gotten as far as Madrid on the other paper! A year later I would be developing film in a bathroom in East-Timor. The following nineteen years would be a roller coaster ride, as they say, with a lot of good stories, a ton of good friends, everything I could have wished for. My dream life was coming true, every single day.</p>\n<p name=\"d3f4\" id=\"d3f4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This is the place where I would grow, as a person and as a photographer. I wouldn’t be the same one if I’d spent the last twenty years somewhere else.</p>\n<p name=\"e0e4\" id=\"e0e4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">And where did I find myself after those twenty years ? Stuck to a desk most of the year, editor for longer than I can remember, spending most of my days looking at other people’s photos instead of my own. I was not as happy as I could be, that’s for sure. I would still get the occasional assignment, but those were far apart and had been getting shorter for a while now. Things have also been different for a while now, even at the dream place.</p>\n<h4 name=\"5d8b\" id=\"5d8b\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">03. After</h4>\n<p name=\"0854\" id=\"0854\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Close to the end of last year we were told by the management that some more cuts would have to be made. We’d been here before, sadly a few times over the years. It’s not a good place to be. This time around a generous severance package was being offered to those who would volunteer. I volunteered.</p>\n<p name=\"1ad6\" id=\"1ad6\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I now find myself in the freelancing position. As I will surely have a lot of extra time on my hands (<a href=\"https://medium.com/@maique/no-country-for-freelancers-49c7c221f850#.5dy8etnw8\" data-href=\"https://medium.com/@maique/no-country-for-freelancers-49c7c221f850#.5dy8etnw8\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" target=\"_blank\">No Country For Freelancers</a>), I thought about blogging again. I will try to keep things separate, the extra geekiness contained at <a href=\"https://guezota.com/\" data-href=\"https://guezota.com/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Guezota Diaries</a> and the day-to-day life of the unemployed photographer at <a href=\"https://chevalierdubois.com/\" data-href=\"https://chevalierdubois.com/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Chevalier du Bois</a>. I plan to share stories about the projects I’ll hopefully get off the ground, as well as stuff about the twenty-something years it took me to get here. These were really cool times, going from film to digital and from paper to online, and I was lucky to be able to live them. Very lucky.</p>\n<blockquote name=\"782b\" id=\"782b\" class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p\">Photography just gets us out of the house</blockquote>\n<blockquote name=\"dd11\" id=\"dd11\" class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf-after--pullquote\">– William Eggleston</blockquote>\n<p name=\"de6b\" id=\"de6b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote graf--trailing\">Feel free to leave a comment below, say hi <a href=\"https://twitter.com/maique\" data-href=\"https://twitter.com/maique\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">via Twitter</a> or through the <a href=\"http://maiquemadeira.com/contact\" data-href=\"http://maiquemadeira.com/contact\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">site</a> if you have any questions or comments, or if you’d like me to cover a particular subject or theme on a future post.

Part of the other arm was added later, black too. And then I stopped. For a decade, no new tattoos. No idea why none were made during that time, it just happened that way. I would go by the studio from time to time, just to check on them, but never got the urge to do another one.</p>\n<p name=\"b19c\" id=\"b19c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This year, though, while in Thailand with theLovelyWife, I wanted a Sak Yant, and we went and met Ajarn Neng, who was <a href=\"https://medium.com/sanuk-tour/sak-yant-cf6e1b64da3c\" data-href=\"https://medium.com/sanuk-tour/sak-yant-cf6e1b64da3c\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" target=\"_blank\">kind enough to do it</a>.</p>\n<p name=\"bcfb\" id=\"bcfb\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Just like that, a line was crossed. Someone else had tattooed me. And it also got me thinking about doing more. Thailand jumpstarted the whole tattoo thing again.</p>\n<p name=\"3a0e\" id=\"3a0e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">We came back home, as one sadly does, and I went to the studio, showing off the Thai work. There was also another small piece that I would like to cover and we started working on that. My leg is getting (still ongoing), a lot more black.</p>\n<p name=\"b49c\" id=\"b49c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">One fine day, while talking tattoos with theLovelyWife she made a comment about color and the fact that I had none. I was left wondering about it. And a couple of days later an intern at work showed me some one he had done a few days earlier. A friend of his, new in town, is doing cool traditional stuff and he done a couple on him. I looked into it and the idea was growing on my mind. I could get some color and, at the same time, a traditional piece. I had none of those too.</p>\n<p name=\"5c65\" id=\"5c65\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">While browsing <a href=\"https://instagram.com/manuelribautattooer\" data-href=\"https://instagram.com/manuelribautattooer\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">his feed on Instagram</a> (where else ?)

Sure. At Nobre Tattoo</figcaption></figure><p name=\"8a21\" id=\"8a21\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Years later we took care of a leg, also black. Part of the other arm was added later, black too. And then I stopped. For a decade, no new tattoos. No idea why none were made during that time, it just happened that way. I would go by the studio from time to time, just to check on them, but never got the urge to do another one.</p>\n<p name=\"b19c\" id=\"b19c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This year, though, while in Thailand with theLovelyWife, I wanted a Sak Yant, and we went and met Ajarn Neng, who was <a href=\"https://medium.com/sanuk-tour/sak-yant-cf6e1b64da3c\" data-href=\"https://medium.com/sanuk-tour/sak-yant-cf6e1b64da3c\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" target=\"_blank\">kind enough to do it</a>.</p>\n<p name=\"bcfb\" id=\"bcfb\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Just like that, a line was crossed. Someone else had tattooed me. And it also got me thinking about doing more. Thailand jumpstarted the whole tattoo thing again.</p>\n<p name=\"3a0e\" id=\"3a0e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">We came back home, as one sadly does, and I went to the studio, showing off the Thai work. There was also another small piece that I would like to cover and we started working on that. My leg is getting (still ongoing), a lot more black.</p>\n<p name=\"b49c\" id=\"b49c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">One fine day, while talking tattoos with theLovelyWife she made a comment about color and the fact that I had none. I was left wondering about it. And a couple of days later an intern at work showed me some one he had done a few days earlier. A friend of his, new in town, is doing cool traditional stuff and he done a couple on him. I looked into it and the idea was growing on my mind. I could get some color and, at the same time, a traditional piece. I had none of those too.</p>\n<p name=\"5c65\" id=\"5c65\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">While browsing <a href=\"https://instagram.com/manuelribautattooer\" data-href=\"https://instagram.com/manuelribautattooer\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">his feed on Instagram</a> (where else ?)

This will be a long one.</p>\n<p name=\"cc6c\" id=\"cc6c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The day had started with another one of those lucky moments when everything seems to magically fall into place. One of Thailand’s best features, as far as I’m concerned.</p>\n<figure name=\"ce58\" id=\"ce58\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 467px;\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*V9cpaAJe9Y4LWnhMS-UFfQ.jpeg\" data-width=\"4896\" data-height=\"3264\" src=\"https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/a5b22cfbe2.jpg\"></div>\n<figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Chiang Mai loveProject</figcaption></figure><p name=\"a059\" id=\"a059\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">To make the trip up to Chiag Mai, we would need to get back to Sukhothai, not the Old one where we were staying, and then all the way back to Phitsanuluk, before boarding our train to Chiang Mai, where we would arrive around dinner time. It would be a full day of travelling, but we had what seemed like a good place at the end of the day so we were cool about that. The only thing that needed solving, and we had tried, was the first bus.</p>\n<p name=\"747b\" id=\"747b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">We had walked around the previous day, trying to figure out where the buses stopped in Old Sukhothai. That old-falling-apart one would do, or even a Mini-van. Something to get us back to a city, a big one. But, for the first time, we’d had some trouble with it, people did not speak a lot of english (read close to nothing) and didn’t seem all that interested in trying to help us. Maybe it was the time of day (we understood that someone was missing at all the places we tried), or maybe it was something else, but we woke up that morning with no clue about that bus. Not too worried because in the end you can always find someone to drive you anywhere, albeit for a price.</p>\n<p name=\"daf7\" id=\"daf7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Packed our bags, had another go at the coconut pudding, said goodbye to Paolo, and asked him to call us a tuk-tuk to drive us to that only road in town, about one km down the road from the guesthouse. My backpack was really heavy and I was in no mood to start the day sweaty from that walk.</p>\n<p name=\"c02d\" id=\"c02d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The tuk-tuk showed up promptly, we loaded our bags and, a couple of minutes later the driver was dropping us off near a huge bus, of the VIP kind. This was one of the places where we had tried to get information the day before, a store that had a sign stating it was a bus stop. However this was the first time we actually saw a bus there. We tried again, with a different person and were told the bus to Sukhothai would show up briefly, maybe 15 minutes. Ok, we could deal with that. We lit a cigarette.</p>\n<p name=\"1d93\" id=\"1d93\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Two minutes later we noticed the driver of the VIP bus talking to the lady who had provided the information, and two minutes more she was telling us that this bus, this very one, would be able to take us to Pithsanulok! We boarded, even before the end of the cigarette! It would save us another bus, and we would be travelling in style. We were also the only two passengers on that double decker.</p>\n<figure name=\"bb34\" id=\"bb34\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetLeft graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 525px; max-height: 350px;\">\n<div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 66.7%;\"></div>\n<img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*vn0IY537so6JaMmS64lMPQ.jpeg\" data-width=\"4896\" data-height=\"3264\" src=\"https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/620eaf884a.jpg\">\n</div>\n<figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Phitsanulok train station</figcaption></figure><p name=\"1c09\" id=\"1c09\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">We made it to the train station in Phitsanulok, and had some time to kill before the train to Chiang Mai. Dropped the big packs at the luggage depot, and walked out of there, to explore the town. A 7-Eleven stop later (thank you for Slurpees), and a brief stop at the market and we (well, I) needed some food. We moved back to the station, walked past an amulet market that’s going on in there, and saw a guy eating what looked like a delicious dish. It had a lot of chillies on top of rice and chicken. My kind of lunch. Walked to the lady selling food, pointed to the dish he was having, and I was served one of the tastiest meals so far. Had a Coke with it and payed 45 baht. A little over a euro. I was set till dinner time.</p>\n<figure name=\"82c8\" id=\"82c8\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 467px;\">\n<div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 66.7%;\"></div>\n<img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*8W36uOHuJoJHyPo0J6FCTA.jpeg\" data-width=\"4896\" data-height=\"3264\" src=\"https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/6a1b0228d1.jpg\">\n</div>\n<figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Kindle time</figcaption></figure><p name=\"8a01\" id=\"8a01\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">The rest of the day was a breeze. Stuck on the train, looking out the window as the world went by, and catching up on the books loaded on our Kindles. We made it to Chiang Mai on time.</p>\n<p name=\"9a24\" id=\"9a24\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Since every tuk-tuk and songtaew driver knows the train schedules, a lot of them make their way to the station, and wait for the farangs. There’s a lot of us on those express trains, and business is guaranteed. Good for us.<br>One of the drivers talked to us, we told him where we wanted to go, agreed on the price and waited for the thing to fill up with other tourists. It was a short wait. When it was full, we were on our way, and soon were being dropped outside <a href=\"http://www.sri-patguesthouse.com\" data-href=\"http://www.sri-patguesthouse.com\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Sri Pat Guesthouse</a>.</p>\n<p name=\"396f\" id=\"396f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">A lovely place, perfectly located to explore the wonderful city of Chiang Mai. You can tell the family that runs the place is really proud of their guesthouse, and with good reason. The place looks like something from a design magazine, it has a small pool, and a little balcony with two tables facing the street, ideal for a stop while people watching. Rooms have balconies too, ours was small but big enough for a smoke.<br>When we go back to Chiang Mai, we’re staying there again, for sure.</p>\n<figure name=\"545e\" id=\"545e\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 467px;\">\n<div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 66.7%;\"></div>\n<img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*uZWKrUPbv2EzUm8iA5yJXw.jpeg\" data-width=\"4553\" data-height=\"3035\" src=\"https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/2481365d75.jpg\">\n</div>\n<figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Schhhhhh</figcaption></figure><p name=\"272a\" id=\"272a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">I‘ve said that Bangkok is my favourite city in the world and, yet, Chiang Mai is my favourite in Thailand.

Perfect size, amazing vibe, cooler weather are just some of the things that we loved in this city.</p>\n<blockquote name=\"a4f8\" id=\"a4f8\" class=\"graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p\">If I had to pick one place in the world to live, this would probably be it.</blockquote>\n<p name=\"321b\" id=\"321b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\">Everything you’ll want to visit is in the old town. You don’t need to worry about transportation, just make sure you have comfortable footware. You’ll want to visit Doi Suthep, and then it might be a good idea to get a motorcycle, but that’s it.

Also a recurring thing, we’d only have to walk around the corner, and were greeted by over a dozen stalls, each one selling food that looked more delicious than the next. We settled on one that had a free table, and had another great meal.</p>\n<p name=\"4c30\" id=\"4c30\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">We had planned to get one of <a href=\"http://nancychandler.net/maps.html\" data-href=\"http://nancychandler.net/maps.html\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Nancy Chandler’s maps</a>. I love maps, and these seemed like very nice ones. We got it at Back Street Books a couple of days later, and would get the Bangkok one when we got back to the capital. Mainly as souvenirs. We didnt’ even use them, as they looked too pretty to mess up.</p>\n<figure name=\"2e9b\" id=\"2e9b\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 467px;\">\n<div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 66.7%;\"></div>\n<img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*_RGTLv3LcA57uyywMskshQ.jpeg\" data-width=\"4780\" data-height=\"3187\" src=\"https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/b16cb03e3a.jpg\">\n</div>\n<figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Sunday Walking Street</figcaption></figure><p name=\"b2f9\" id=\"b2f9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">There’s plenty of sites around that are worth a visit, and please make sure you spend a weekend there as <a href=\"http://www.lonelyplanet.com/thailand/chiang-mai-province/chiang-mai/sights/markets-bazaars/sunday-walking-street\" data-href=\"http://www.lonelyplanet.com/thailand/chiang-mai-province/chiang-mai/sights/markets-bazaars/sunday-walking-street\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Sunday Walking Street</a> is something you should definitely not miss.

You’ll find music students playing their instrument of choice, old ladies singing with support band, a pop star that will sing while people take selfies, dozens of selfies, a few blind musicians bands, sitting in a line on the floor… It’s a mess.

You make your way through the throng of tourists dumped by dozens of buses, into the tunnel made by the stalls, past the children dressed in ethnic garb that know only one word of english (‘Money’), up the hundreds of stairs and you’re there.

And the rest of the zoo is just one sad animal after another, visitors feeding them non-stop and, as soon as there’s a break in the feeding frenzy, the animals start acting like junkies, furiously pacing back and forth, waiting for the next fix. I’m not an expert on wild animal care, but we left with a strong suspicion that some of this behaviour is probably abuse.

It looked so fun that we went in and soon we were involved in them. I made a flower from wax, and tried not to embarrass myself while doing it. Don’t think I made it that far, but the flower was good enough to pin on the tree they were making.

Students practising routines on the school grounds, photography exhibitions organised by NGOs, markets... We had a jazz festival going on at the time, with daily concerts at Pratu Thapae, next to the huge wooden door. Some of the bigger hotels had food tasting stalls, complete with chefs.</p>\n<p name=\"8fc7\" id=\"8fc7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Another place that made us feel extra welcome, and one that saw us come back time and time again was <a href=\"http://cafedethaanaoan.com/\" data-href=\"http://cafedethaanaoan.com/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Café de Thaan Aoan</a>. We went there for breakfast, or tea. Yummy milk shakes, delicious pancakes and crispy bacon with scrambled eggs. We found it while looking for a place to have breakfast, in between wats. They made the best pineapple pancake I had in the whole month. I could swear the two pancakes were hiding a whole pineapple inside them.</p>\n<figure name=\"2803\" id=\"2803\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 467px;\">\n<div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 66.7%;\"></div>\n<img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*nhKOXYzh9Ymz6Vl8wv_e5Q.jpeg\" data-width=\"4706\" data-height=\"3137\" src=\"https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/e6845cc6ed.jpg\">\n</div>\n<figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Wats galore</figcaption></figure><p name=\"7420\" id=\"7420\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">If you feel that you should visit a wat (or ten), Chiang Mai has you covered. We went to Wat Phan Tao, Wat Chedi Luang Varavihara, Wat Phra Sing Waramahavihan, Wat Phakhao and a lot of others. They’re all amazing, but we do have a thing for wats. On Chedi Luang I got my first monk offered bracelet, the white skinny ones. I was following a monk around the temple, as I do, trying to get a decent photo, and he sat down in a huge chair and started fiddling with a huge roll of string.. As I positioned myself for the shot, he invited me to kneel in front of me, and made a bracelet. Wrapped it around my wrist, and said a prayer while he doused me with water. The camera survived, and I was a different man.</p>\n<figure name=\"b894\" id=\"b894\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 467px;\">\n<div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 66.7%;\"></div>\n<img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*PCvT6JQIuzO4Xv9wFxqSCA.jpeg\" data-width=\"4896\" data-height=\"3264\" src=\"https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/8d6fcfbcb0.jpg\">\n</div>\n<figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Feeding time at the wat</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--outsetRow\" data-paragraph-count=\"2\">\n<figure name=\"08c7\" id=\"08c7\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetRow is-partialWidth graf-after--figure\" style=\"width: 50%;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\">\n<div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 66.7%;\"></div>\n<img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*9WxkBW8pNzN2W21PHcFXsg.jpeg\" data-width=\"4896\" data-height=\"3264\" src=\"https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/87104072d0.jpg\">\n</div></figure><figure name=\"391e\" id=\"391e\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetRowContinue is-partialWidth graf-after--figure\" style=\"width: 50%;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\">\n<div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 66.7%;\"></div>\n<img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*GF0zmcy2drCX1B6JKQEhTg.jpeg\" data-width=\"4581\" data-height=\"3054\" src=\"https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/7fc7d77cf3.jpg\">\n</div></figure>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p name=\"784a\" id=\"784a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">You can visit one in the morning, and students will be going from class to class, and come again in the afternoon and they’ll be taking care of the garden.

This will be a long one.</p>\n<p name=\"cc6c\" id=\"cc6c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The day had started with another one of those lucky moments when everything seems to magically fall into place. One of Thailand’s best features, as far as I’m concerned.</p>\n<figure name=\"ce58\" id=\"ce58\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 467px;\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*V9cpaAJe9Y4LWnhMS-UFfQ.jpeg\" data-width=\"4896\" data-height=\"3264\" src=\"https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/a5b22cfbe2.jpg\"></div>\n<figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Chiang Mai loveProject</figcaption></figure><p name=\"a059\" id=\"a059\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">To make the trip up to Chiag Mai, we would need to get back to Sukhothai, not the Old one where we were staying, and then all the way back to Phitsanuluk, before boarding our train to Chiang Mai, where we would arrive around dinner time. It would be a full day of travelling, but we had what seemed like a good place at the end of the day so we were cool about that. The only thing that needed solving, and we had tried, was the first bus.</p>\n<p name=\"747b\" id=\"747b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">We had walked around the previous day, trying to figure out where the buses stopped in Old Sukhothai. That old-falling-apart one would do, or even a Mini-van. Something to get us back to a city, a big one. But, for the first time, we’d had some trouble with it, people did not speak a lot of english (read close to nothing) and didn’t seem all that interested in trying to help us. Maybe it was the time of day (we understood that someone was missing at all the places we tried), or maybe it was something else, but we woke up that morning with no clue about that bus. Not too worried because in the end you can always find someone to drive you anywhere, albeit for a price.</p>\n<p name=\"daf7\" id=\"daf7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Packed our bags, had another go at the coconut pudding, said goodbye to Paolo, and asked him to call us a tuk-tuk to drive us to that only road in town, about one km down the road from the guesthouse. My backpack was really heavy and I was in no mood to start the day sweaty from that walk.</p>\n<p name=\"c02d\" id=\"c02d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The tuk-tuk showed up promptly, we loaded our bags and, a couple of minutes later the driver was dropping us off near a huge bus, of the VIP kind. This was one of the places where we had tried to get information the day before, a store that had a sign stating it was a bus stop. However this was the first time we actually saw a bus there. We tried again, with a different person and were told the bus to Sukhothai would show up briefly, maybe 15 minutes. Ok, we could deal with that.

A 7-Eleven stop later (thank you for Slurpees), and a brief stop at the market and we (well, I) needed some food. We moved back to the station, walked past an amulet market that’s going on in there, and saw a guy eating what looked like a delicious dish. It had a lot of chillies on top of rice and chicken. My kind of lunch. Walked to the lady selling food, pointed to the dish he was having, and I was served one of the tastiest meals so far. Had a Coke with it and payed 45 baht. A little over a euro.

And the rest of the zoo is just one sad animal after another, visitors feeding them non-stop and, as soon as there’s a break in the feeding frenzy, the animals start acting like junkies, furiously pacing back and forth, waiting for the next fix. I’m not an expert on wild animal care, but we left with a strong suspicion that some of this behaviour is probably abuse.

We went to Wat Phan Tao, Wat Chedi Luang Varavihara, Wat Phra Sing Waramahavihan, Wat Phakhao and a lot of others. They’re all amazing, but we do have a thing for wats. On Chedi Luang I got my first monk offered bracelet, the white skinny ones. I was following a monk around the temple, as I do, trying to get a decent photo, and he sat down in a huge chair and started fiddling with a huge roll of string.. As I positioned myself for the shot, he invited me to kneel in front of me, and made a bracelet. Wrapped it around my wrist, and said a prayer while he doused me with water. The camera survived, and I was a different man.</p>\n<figure name=\"b894\" id=\"b894\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 467px;\">\n<div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 66.7%;\"></div>\n<img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*PCvT6JQIuzO4Xv9wFxqSCA.jpeg\" data-width=\"4896\" data-height=\"3264\" src=\"https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/8d6fcfbcb0.jpg\">\n</div>\n<figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Feeding time at the wat</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--outsetRow\" data-paragraph-count=\"2\">\n<figure name=\"08c7\" id=\"08c7\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetRow is-partialWidth graf-after--figure\" style=\"width: 50%;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\">\n<div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 66.7%;\"></div>\n<img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*9WxkBW8pNzN2W21PHcFXsg.jpeg\" data-width=\"4896\" data-height=\"3264\" src=\"https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/87104072d0.jpg\">\n</div></figure><figure name=\"391e\" id=\"391e\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetRowContinue is-partialWidth graf-after--figure\" style=\"width: 50%;\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\">\n<div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 66.7%;\"></div>\n<img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*GF0zmcy2drCX1B6JKQEhTg.jpeg\" data-width=\"4581\" data-height=\"3054\" src=\"https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/7fc7d77cf3.jpg\">\n</div></figure>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\"><p name=\"784a\" id=\"784a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">You can visit one in the morning, and students will be going from class to class, and come again in the afternoon and they’ll be taking care of the garden.

Another cool way to find out about spots for a visit. Graph Café, even though it’s very small, is a place made for Instagram.

It’s not a place I would recommend, but we had stuff to do there, so there you go. I’m not even searching that one on Foursquare. No link for you, it’s better this way, trust me.</p>\n<figure name=\"d43f\" id=\"d43f\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 700px; max-height: 467px;\">\n<div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 66.7%;\"></div>\n<img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*wZVh8erjEtpDfdygj-7nyQ.jpeg\" data-width=\"3264\" data-height=\"2176\" src=\"https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/f7271d4222.jpg\">\n</div>\n<figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Aloha shirt in unexciting Moscavide</figcaption></figure><p name=\"384d\" id=\"384d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">We came back as soon as we could and found the <a href=\"https://foursquare.com/v/parque-da-fonte-luminosa/4be1b27dae55a5935f3c5b62\" data-href=\"https://foursquare.com/v/parque-da-fonte-luminosa/4be1b27dae55a5935f3c5b62\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Fonte Luminosa</a> turned on. You will find this park, complete with a huge fountain (the actual Fonte), close to the northern end of Almirante Reis. You might remember this street from yesterday’s walk, and this here fountain is one of the nicest things on it. It’s not always turned on, but today we found it like this.
