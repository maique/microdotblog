<p>Still under mandatory curfew from 1PM onwards, we’re getting up and taking care of business before that time.</p>

<p>Trying to edit a few more photos while tinyMovieStar deals with teething. Not easy, I can’t imagine the pain she’s in.</p>

         	<p>Not that I’ve ever needed to sign, or encrypt, an email. But I wanted to figure out how to go about it.</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2021/0d4fc2f8bc.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I’ve finally managed to create the keys, get the email client configured, and send my first encrypted email. To myself.</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2021/aac72744e9.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve started reading about the process a few times before, but gave up at some point, as it felt too complicated. Now, with <a href="https://freron.com">MailMate</a> and yesterday&rsquo;s <a href="https://canarymail.io">Canary Mail</a> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/canary-mail/id1155470386">for iOS</a> purchase, I felt I needed to sort this, just for the challenge.</p>

<p>Still don&rsquo;t need it working, but wanted to see if I could set it up. While still not too sure about the whole thing, it is working. On macOS AND iOS. Used <a href="https://gpgtools.org">GPGTools</a> for the job.</p>

<p>Need a lot more time to read all the documentation, but I can now send and receive encrypted emails! Yay!</p>

<p>Heavy rain for a couple of minutes, right before we were about to leave for our January 1st first walk.</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2021/146638dd56.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Waited a little and the sun finally made it out. And so did we.</p>

<p>It was packed with people exchanging Christmas gifts, so we turned around and walked down the street again. Done.</p>

         	<p>2020.</p>

<p>It really was an amazingly odd year, I don&rsquo;t even know where to start.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll leave the <em>Big Picture</em> stuff to other people. It&rsquo;s been talked about, discussed, analysed, dissected, already, so no need for me to chip in on those subjects.</p>

<p>For me this year was about:</p>

<ul>
<li>Becoming a parent</li>
<li>Not working for most of the year</li>
<li>Living with the in-laws for almost six months</li>
<li>Moving back to our place, then out of our place and into a rental one</li>
<li>Micro.blog</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Parenthood</strong></p>

<p>It’s amazing. Yes. And tiresome. Yes.</p>

<p>We have no idea what we’re doing, and it seems we knew everything about it <strong>before</strong> becoming parents. How mistaken we were!
When tinyMovieStar was born we felt a new version of us was also just coming to life. We&rsquo;ve grown, together, and it&rsquo;s been amazing. Words fail me, but we are blown away every day by something she does, we &lsquo;Awwww&rsquo; and &lsquo;Ohhhhh&rsquo; every few minutes.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also feeling, at once, like the sweeper car on a bicycle ride, and the front car on a F1 race.
Prepping stuff for movieStar, and cleaning up after her. Never felt so tired, and yet I wake up every day wanting to do it all over again.</p>

<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s overwhelming, so we try to take it one step at a time. Not thinking too much about the future, how she&rsquo;ll turn out, if we will screw everything up,&hellip;<br />
So far, so good. She looks pretty happy, we&rsquo;re also very pleased with the way things are progressing.</p>

<p><strong>Work</strong></p>

<p>As parenthood takes up a great part of the day (all of it!), the cancelled jobs I had due to the pandemic actually ended up being a plus, if I can put it that way.<br />
I was able to spend most of the year at home, with both girls, and I&rsquo;m sure I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to enjoy this as much if I had a job. The government offered the tiniest of help (I would say ridiculous), but we&rsquo;re fortunate movieStar has a <em>proper</em> job, with decent benefits. Also counting as lucky the generous help my parents provided. I was able to get by thanks to them.</p>

<p>Also first time I missed the old job at the paper. We&rsquo;d grown accustomed to being on the road a lot since I quit, and spending a few months a year on the island. We missed both of those and, as most people around the world, are a bit tired of being stuck in one place.</p>

<p>After decades of covering news, and getting out of that business, I failed to miss it until now. Being at home while the biggest story of the decade unfolded outside made me miss the old days, of being on top of things. With no island and no travel to keep me entertained, it was bound to happen.</p>

<p>The end of the year turned out to be a surprise, a lot of work. Pros and cons but, by now, I&rsquo;m pretty grateful it happened.</p>

<p><strong>Living arrangements</strong></p>

<p>We spent almost half the year living with movieStar&rsquo;s parents, who were kind enough to offer us their home. When the pandemic struck we feared we&rsquo;d be overwhelmed by it and the new baby, so that came as a very welcome offer. We had a support team for as long as we needed, and it was a blessing.</p>

<p>When we felt we could handle things on our own we moved back into the city, but soon realised our home would be small to house the three of us. movieStar started looking for a place that would be suitable, and she found it! I expected to stay at our place for a little longer, but babies do take up a lot of space. We moved.</p>

<p><strong>Micro.blog</strong></p>

<p>When we moved out of the city, before tinyMovieStar was born, I looked for a new home online, and by god I found it! It&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve been so happy with the internet. The community never ceases to amaze me, it&rsquo;s a wonderful place, one I hope will last.
I&rsquo;ve had great conversations, found amazing shows to watch, discovered wonderful apps, and, above all that, the best group of people one can find online.</p>

<p>All in all, for me, it was a great year. I know everyone is expecting 2021 to be the good one, the one that will get us over the mess that 2020 was, but I&rsquo;m pretty pleased with how it turned out.</p>

         	<p>During our walk this afternoon, tinyMovieStar strapped to my chest, phone in my hand trying to get a photo of a building. Someone came from behind us, grabbed me, and said &ldquo;Hand over all your money!&rdquo;.</p>

<p>All I could think was &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to wake her up, you silly bastard!&rdquo;.</p>

<p>All that was left to do was to turn around, calmly, and see which one of my crazy friends was messing with her sleep!</p>

<p>This is such a quiet city it never even crossed my mind the <em>robbery</em> was for real.</p>

<p>It was our first trip with tinyMovieStar, even though she was still happily tucked away in movieStar’s belly.</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/1a1c4f2e3b.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Loved the cool architecture, something we’re missing a little around here.</p>

<p>We got the apartment, after a few days of back and forth with the owner’s lawyers, and we’ll move in a few days. No worries anymore, just a lot of stuff to deal with.</p>

<p>Today is celebration day, so we went for a few beers with the gang.</p>

<p>Away from the square. But not too far.</p>

<p>Morning spent waiting for the package, and also trying to get a present for mom. Surprisingly some shops now open at noon (!), and I simply don’t get it. Dead in the center of the city, one of the places where tourists and locals are abundant. I would expect shopkeepers to do everything imaginable to keep money coming in, and opening at that time is baffling. Then again, I’m not a business oriented person, so I might be missing the point.</p>

<p>Lunch with parents and brother, a bit later because we had to wait for that shop to open.
My parents are crazy in love with tinyMovieStar, and enjoy having her around as much as possible. We send them daily photo updates, and a few videos, but seeing her tops all that.</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/f00ccbfaa9.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Mid-afternoon quickly arrived and it was time to get back home to help a friend editing some photos for a show and book he’s working on. Amazing work, as usual with this one. We had beer, of course.</p>

         	<p>I had the pleasure of speaking to <a href="https://micro.blog/macgenie">@macgenie</a> for the <a href="https://monday.micro.blog/2020/10/12/maique-photographer-new.html">latest episode</a> of <a href="https://monday.micro.blog">Micro Monday</a>.</p>

<p>I was quite nervous, first interview in English, and for a podcast celebrating the community that I’m so happy to be a part of, but Jean is the best and I was able to forget a bit of the anxiety and talk for a bit.</p>

<p>Hope it turned out ok and look forward to hear your thoughts about it.</p>

<p>Also, tomorrow is <a href="https://micro.welltempered.net/2020/09/24/a-day-in.html">A Day In The Life of Our Online Community: A Global Photography Challenge</a>, so don’t forget to shoot something, indoors, outdoors, anything goes. It’s going to be fun!</p>

<p>We turned right where we usually turn left, and ended up in Lapa today. Posh part of town. Was looking for a particular building to shoot, but it was covered in scaffolding.</p>

<p>No harm done, a message to our favorite cousins and we had lunch with them, and stayed a while.</p>

         	<p>Prompted by Michael, <a href="https://photog.social/@mpmilestogo/104969796761952639">on Mastodon</a>, I’m reminiscing about that special boozy day in Valladolid.</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/4493d5962a.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We’d been in Mexico for a few days, slowly making our way down the eastern coast of Yucatán, enjoying the beaches and the food, but it was time to move inland. We were heading to Valladolid.</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/6b9ba5128b.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We drove out tiny Chevrolet for a few hours, and parked at what would be our home for the next few days, a <a href="https://www.colonte.com">cosy hotel</a> near the center of town. We would use this as our base camp, and from there explore the city and a few other spots around it.</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/687cf8e86c.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Chichén-Itzá, Rio Lagartos up north, Izamal and Mérida, all within driving distance. I’ll leave that for another post.</p>

<p>After all that sightseeing was done we still had a day left in town, so we decided to visit another cenote. We’d had a lot of fun at the previous ones close to Tulum, seemed like a perfect way to relax and end our stay in the city before moving on to Holbox.</p>

<p>We had a recommendation from a friend who had been in the area, so we decided to spend some time at the one he’d been to.</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/e264e64881.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Enter <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com.mx/Attraction_Review-g499453-d3984008-Reviews-Hacienda_San_Lorenzo_Oxman-Valladolid_Yucatan_Peninsula.html">Hacienda San Lorenzo Oxman</a>.</p>

<p>The hacienda is close to town, a bike would be ok, but it was too hot and we had the car with air con, so why complicate things ? We drove there, and were not impressed by the road. It’s mostly a dirt road or, better, a dirty dirt road, but this only lasts for a little while, and you’re soon leaving your car at the parking and stepping in.</p>

<p>Ticket wise we were presented with two options: pay a smaller fee and get access to the cenote, and you can sit at the pool for as long as you want, but are only allowed a shaded spot if there’s no one with a <em>premium</em> tier ticket, or just get that other ticket, still very cheap, and you can have unlimited shade, cenote, and the whole ticket cost can be used at the bar, for food and drinks.</p>

<p>We were planning on staying there for a while, and have lunch anyway, so we ended up getting the costlier one.</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/5b522f9412.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>First things first, the cenote. Our previous ones had been <em>open</em> ones, a bit like a pool with some cave parts thrown in, but this was a huge pit. Like a chimney, light filtering in from above, but wide, with crystal clear water, and a big swing to dive in from. We loved it.</p>

<p>It was too hot outside, but the temperature here was perfect, the water cool, and the place near deserted. It was still early in the morning.</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/7f472397e9.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>A few jumps later and we moved to the pool. We had the pool to ourselves, and the water felt like soup after the cenote dives.</p>

<p>We sat under one of the umbrellas, still unaware we’d be spending most of the day there.</p>

<p>We asked for a couple of Modelo beers. Time to start redeeming that ticket cost. Beer was cheap, so the tickets would go a long way.</p>

<p>We would drink a bottle, go into the pool, come out, drink another, go into the pool, &hellip; you get the idea.</p>

<p>Some food as ordered. Some margaritas as well.</p>

<p>I started Shazaming the music, it was an amazing playlist, perfect for the occasion. We still listen to those from time to time.</p>

<p>Down to the cenote again to cool down. But the pool was still our own private pool.</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/ce45ede60d.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We felt (and this might have been the beer talking already) like Mexican millionaires, enjoying our hacienda, with a caring staff that kept bringing us food and beverages.</p>

<p>After a while we were both in the pool, lounging about, and one of them would walk by and casually ask “Dos más ?”. “Sí, por favor. Gracias.”</p>

<p>Other guest were arriving by now, but still not too many. Most were Mexicans living in the States, back for a vacation, meeting their families and having a good time around the pool, talking about life with the gringos. Everyone was happy to be back home, and the mood on the pool was full of good vibes.</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/4100137516.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Guess what ? We had a couple more beers, and then had to wait for hours until I was legal for the drive back to the hotel.</p>

<p>It turned out to be one of the coolest days in Mexico, and cool days in Mexico are very easy to come by!</p>

         	<p>Today’s schedule was dictated by the delivery companies, as we can’t leave the house when something is being delivered.</p>

<p>I took care of the morning walk, movieStar at home waiting for the packages, which did not arrive until well after lunch.</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/a4b9fd6484.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Following a tip from <a href="https://micro.blog/helgeg">@helgeg</a> we then watched an episode of <strong>Chef’s Table</strong>, the one about Ivan Ramen. It was really cool and we enjoyed it a lot. I still have most of the book to go through, but the experience has improved by watching the man on the show.</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/80add2a6aa.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>When everything was delivered we left the house for a walk, and were joined by a friend who has a woodworking studio in the area. We ended up visiting, and stayed there for a while.</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/bad66f6e2b.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/7c7e7474a5.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We got back home, ready to start cooking dinner, I felt extra tired. In my mind, with the morning walk closer to home, and the shorter one in the afternoon, there was no reason for that. I had already forgotten the one I had walking back with the package in my hands! It turns out I walked a very respectable 10K.</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/538aa7b5f7.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>tinyMovieStar is getting heavier. My lower back noticed.</p>

         	<p>Today was a long day. A very long, yet happy, day.</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/0140200dcc.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>tinyMovieStar woke up too early and, strangely, didn’t fall asleep after a light snack.</p>

<p>We needed coffee, again, and I <em>needed</em> a new kitchen knife, so off we went. Time for our morning walk.</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/bd226d2454.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>It was so early we had to wait in the street until opening hours. We got the coffee, but couldn’t find the knife, <a href="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/2020/09/25/pollux.html">Pollux</a> failed me for the first time in my life!</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/8697a6f639.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We came back home just in time for the next <em>assignment</em>. My father-in-law was picking us up for lunch and a visit to their new home.</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/f5db012439.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We went to Cascais, a quick ride, and had a wonderful meal in their new place, a smaller house, but nice all the same. Both movieStar’s brothers were also there, so family lunch it was.</p>

<p>Ordered the knife online while having coffee after we ate, and got the shipped notice an hour later! Wow for that too. See you, Pollux!</p>

<p>Still time to visit one of the brother-in-law’s new place. Also a lovely house, also in Cascais. The whole family loves that city.</p>

<p>Next up: pick up our car, the one that’s been staying with them for four years. We don’t really need a car in town, but they have no use for it anymore, so it’s time to get it back in town.</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/70eea8b986.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>On the way home we drove it to another friend’s place, picked up a few second hand clothes for tinyMovieStar, talked a bit, and then slowly made our way back to the city.</p>

<p>There’s was an accident on the highway, so the ride back took way longer than we had hoped, but still made it in time for a beer with a group of Italian friends, and a ramen dinner with our closest Portuguese ones.</p>

<p>TLDR: we have our car back in town, after a trip to another town. Visited a ton of people. Had beer and ramen. Happy.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I’m not one to enjoy shopping. I don’t shop for clothes until my shirts are quitting on me. I always get the same brand of boots. Trousers are almost always the brand and model I’ve been wearing for decades. Whenever I find something I like, you can bet I’ll order again. And again.</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/70781eaaff.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>But there’s one shop in town I love: Pollux. The name alone is enough to get a smile out of me.</p>

<p>It’s been on the same place for decades, and it used to be the only decent place in town to get everything you need for your home. The name sounded from the future back in the 80s, and, somewhat predictably, sounds a bit vintage today. Pollux.</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/1fecc2cf2b.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Today you can find the same things in shops all over town, and online, but going there feels like going into a time machine, while still getting modern items.
The place kept it’s old school vibe, the people there as well (even the younger ones!), but the seven floors are still filled with everything you might desire.</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/ce64f426c7.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Today we got the Brabantia bags, the Brita filters, a couple of jars, a new kitchen knife I <em>needed</em> and a bread one for my mother.</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/06b44869a7.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The longer I spend there, the bigger the shopping bag has to be.</p>

<p>Oh! And we forgot our shopping bag at home, so I got one of theirs, a reusable one. If hipsters find out they have them at Pollux, they’ll stop using their usual tote bags, and get one of these. Ironically, of course.</p>

<p>We walked to Pollux. Took a slightly different way to get there, a more <em>scenic</em> one, trying to get different photos to post here.</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/f89c526427.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Walked back, saw some tourists, some street performers, and had a white chocolate Frappuccino! I’m getting addicted to those.</p>

         	<p>Really nice way to end the day. We didn&rsquo;t get our afternoon walk, but did meet <a href="https://micro.blog/helgeg">@helgeg</a>, so that was more than worth it.</p>

<p>A couple of beers were shared, and a few friends showed up to top it off.</p>

<p>And Panda Cantina&rsquo;s ramen is still yummy.</p>

<p>Perfect day.</p>

<p>Went to Sagres and Ponta da Piedade, and Alvor (yuck!), but tinyMovieStar is always asleep when we get somewhere, so we just keep going&hellip;</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>One of the stops we made during our extended honeymoon was Bali. I had been only once, for a single night, on a layover to another, more remote, island. That had been years before I ever thought I’d go back, and at the time I was working, so that’s a story for another day.</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/fe0f8733de.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We both knew we wanted to go there, but we didn’t want to spend time in the crowded areas. We did what the cool kids were doing and booked Ubud. Turns out there’s a LOT of cool kids, and Ubud was a little too crowded as well, although still very enjoyable. But we needed to find a quieter place, and MovieStar had picked Nusa Penida, a small island not far by speed boat.</p>

<p>Not sure how things are today, but at the time there were not a lot of places where we could spend a few nights on that island, and one jumped at us: <a href="https://batansabo.com">Batan Sabo</a>. It looked amazing, relaxed and comfortable. We booked it, and a couple of emails were sent back and forth, setting up a transfer from the dock and other smaller things. Turns out the owner was a very cool and respected photographer on the archipelago! We didn’t know it yet, but he would be the most gracious host, and the proverbial cherry on top of an amazing stay.</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/1d9cc7d4e8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The island is beautiful, and on its way to becoming an <em>influencer</em> magnet, so things might be different now. The <a href="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/2020/06/21/a-cliff-fit.html">cliffs</a> are superb, and it’s <a href="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/2020/07/27/we-could-be.html">easy to understand</a> why they attract so many of these particular travelers.</p>

<p>Moving on&hellip; we arrived and it soon became apparent we had picked the right place.</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/23a68664c1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="https://instagram.com/pandeheryana">Pande Heryana</a> welcomed us to his small cottage, decorated in standard hipster style, and soon we were laughing together, while we ate delicious food and he played the guitar for us. We talked photography and life, tourism and opportunities.</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/51146964fc.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The island is really small, and although it has more than a few spots that are very much worth a visit, Pande spends a lot of time on the big island, shooting couples on honeymoon and a few weddings as well. Tourism was growing on his native island, we wasn’t sure how that would turn out, a bit scared it would ruin the authenticity of the place, but he decided to open the cottage with his brothers, and have a go at the hospitality business.</p>

<p>First night on the island and we were already loving it.</p>

<p>Morning came and we were getting ready to have breakfast, and Pande told us there would be a wedding in the family in a couple of days and that he would like to invite us to attend the ceremony. He insisted, and so did his wife.</p>

<p>I only had one shirt that I thought would be appropriate, and he said he would help us with that as well. We shouldn’t worry.</p>

<p>How many times would we be able to attend one of these weddings in our lifetime? I would say none, or, if we are very lucky, one. We were very lucky.</p>

<p>Two days later I picked up the camera, put on my best shirt, and the traditional headwear and skirt, movieStar was helped by Pande’s wife, <a href="https://instagram.com/jejeprimaw">Prima</a>, and off we went.</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/9caba072cf.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We were treated like family, with the little ones looking at us with curiosity (my beard is an amazing ice breaker), the older ones pushing food into our mouths, just like home.</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/fef917fda2.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/7b27650e38.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Flowers were offered to multiple gods, and we tried to understand as much as we could, and answer as many questions as possible. They were as interested in us as we were in them. It was one of the most gratifying days of the whole trip. It was amazing to be able to interact with them on that level, and the memories we brought home are still very alive. We still talk to them from time to time, checking in on their family, and they now do the same with our new tinyMovieStar.</p>

<p>In the end, that’s why we travel.</p>

<p>Not the best day for this, but truth is it&rsquo;s Friday night.. she knows it!</p>

<p>We ran out of coffee, so the destination of today’s morning walk was decided: Chiado.</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/5a84b02a5b.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>A break in the editing chore and off we went, 5K round-trip.</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/ca827fb757.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>It’s another hot day in town, so we tried to go a bit earlier than usual.</p>

         	<p>Setting up a page for my photo contributions to the August Photoblogging Challenge.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m getting them all together on a <a href="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/mbaug">page</a>, and noticed the code block could be handy for the comments on the photos, since I&rsquo;m not posting any code anyway.</p>

<p>The CSS was all messed up for the code block part, and I can tell you editing that CSS file on the iPhone is no easy task. Didn&rsquo;t want to fire up the computer, and managed in the end, but it takes forever to do that.</p>

<p>Some parts of Micro.blog are not really meant to be dealt with on mobile, I guess.
The content editing on pages and other files is slow, messy, and doesn&rsquo;t work as it should on iOS.</p>

<p>Still a few days to go before the challenge is over, but black and white is so out of the ordinary for me that I&rsquo;m actually enjoying looking at the photos, and picking them has been too much fun.</p>

<p>We finally made it to the river! It’s not far, but we’ve been stretching the walks a bit every day, figuring out how far we can go before the little one grows restless, or hot, or hungry.</p>

<p>And today we did it!</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/055a569902.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>On the way down we went though São Paulo, the huge EDP building, Mercado da Ribeira, and Cais do Sodré.</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/bd49f98780.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/ae3c0463f6.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/dd084fa568.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Sadly we picked the worst time, the sun was blazing and no shadows to hide, so the river stop (there’s little shade in the area) was a short one.</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/802cb8933a.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>There’s a lot of construction going on all around, and we still found a few tourists, as all these spots are <em>mandatory</em> when they visit the city.</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/099eccd866.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Some of the restaurants are still closed, but the Time Out Market seems to be doing ok. Our favorite <em>bifana</em> place, however, seems to have gone out of business.</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/4d496bcaf7.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/42082f9550.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>And back up the hill, Camões, Adamastor, and we were close to home again. Just down one hill and Up another. Everything here is up and down hills!</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/1bb6bc4961.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/de59d54bcd.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Quick pit stop to feed tinyMovieStar, and the final stretch home.</p>

<p>It’s a wonderful place, right in the middle of the city. Once inside you’ll forget the busy (not so much these days) streets around it.</p>

<p>Covid rules are in place, so you’ll have your temperature taken before being allowed in, and there’s a limit on how many people can be inside at the same time.</p>

<p>Waking up a bit earlier than expected, again, so why not go to the market and get a little produce ? On our way!</p>

<p>Today there was no Arts&amp;Crafts, just the vegetable/flower part of the market, but that’s what we were looking for anyway.</p>

<p>On the way back a couple of motorcycles caught my attention. One is a classic Portuguese FAMEL, the other looks like an LML, a fake Vespa.</p>

<p>Going on the opposite direction of the way we usually take, up the other hill (there&rsquo;s always a hill over here!), you’ll end up in Jardim da Estrela.</p>

<p>It’s a nice, big enough, garden. Plenty of parents with kids, and a lot of personal trainers doing one-on-one sessions with clients.</p>

<p>After a stroll in the park, down to Rato, slowly, and back to Príncipe Real.</p>

<p>Today we decided to have lunch at the wonderful <a href="https://www.wurst.pt/servus-and-welcome">Wurst</a>, where the nice Austrian Maria prepares yummy sausages. There’s also a really nice IPA from her home country, and the most delicious ice cream across the street.</p>

<p>This corner is such a great place for a quick meal it was featured extensively on Lisbon’s episode of <a href="https://philrosenthalworld.com/somebody-feed-phil-lisbon/">Somebody Feed Phil</a>.</p>

<p>A bit, but not much, longer than the usual walk, today we did 6km.</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/226f835ae9.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The day is beautiful, the sun is out and we have nice long shadows to play with. There’s a breeze so it doesn’t feel too hot.</p>

From time to time a larger plane lands. Party time.</p>

<p>Going through the Bairro Alto you can’t help notice that almost all the buildings have a different shade of paint on the ground floor, newer, and the other floors have kept the older <em>version</em> of the same color.</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/1752dc9696.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We were finding this stranger by the minute, and asked a restaurant owner why they had decided on such a crazy paint job.</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/e278f59818.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Turns out the ground floors are constantly tagged by street artists, the city council dispatches a team to clean them from time to time, and then the owners of the buildings hire someone, or take it upon themselves, to repaint the whole thing.</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/79ba2ee1f6.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>But not the <em>whole</em> building, just the part they’re in charge of.</p>

<p>The whole neighborhood looks like a crazy patchwork.</p>

He lives and works in Príncipe, and we were lucky to share a few cups of coffee with him, along with other amazing things he produces, and a few words of wisdom as well.</p>

<p>My wife met him ages ago, and I was fortunate to have been introduced and accepted in. We would visit Claudio from time to time at his beautiful home, and spend a little time listening to stories about his very full and exciting life (there’s a film in there, I’m sure, the Wikipedia article reads like a script).</p>

<p>Being unable to travel to the island at the moment I usually miss our family there, or the beaches, or the end of the afternoons drinking beer and talking to friends, or the usual things one misses in a place one loves. But today I’m missing the coffee Claudio makes in a little stove in his kitchen.</p>

<p>I’ve never had a better cup.</p>

Happy to report everyone slept very well.</p>

         	<p>I Love footnotes!<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:kji"><a href="#fn:kji">1</a></sup></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m really happy<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:bpo"><a href="#fn:bpo">2</a></sup> that I can finally start using plug-ins on my site!</p>

<p>First one had to be <a href="https://github.com/jsonbecker/plugin-bigfoot">Bigfoot</a>, by <a href="https://micro.blog/jsonbecker">@jsonbecker</a>. I had to.</p>

<p>I wanted to try them out, but I had changed a couple of things on the theme<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:h2y"><a href="#fn:h2y">3</a></sup>. Today I found it was really easy to do it anyway, <a href="https://micro.blog/manton">@manton</a> has a <a href="https://github.com/microdotblog/theme-kiko/commit/94d417d53f8db45306af30d6d4f498ebded617d7">solution</a> for every issue<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:jl4"><a href="#fn:jl4">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>A couple of lines on two of the files, and I was set. I can now use footnotes on all the posts<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:kec"><a href="#fn:kec">5</a></sup>!</p>

<p>Also installed <a href="https://github.com/thatguygriff/plugin-open-graph">Open Graph Cards</a>, by <a href="https://micro.blog/thatguygriff">@thatguygriff</a> and now my posts on Mastodon look much nicer.</p>

<p>Bonus: If you&rsquo;re a Drafts user<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:jke"><a href="#fn:jke">6</a></sup>, you can add <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1QT">Footnote 2</a> to your Markdown keyboard, and including footnotes is a breeze.</p>

         	<p>Ask, and you shall receive!</p>

<p>I wanted to be able to add a Micro.blog emoji to my profile at Mastodon.Social. The administrators at another instance had done that in the past (thank you!), but I decided to stay at the _mother_instance in the end. So I asked <a href="https://mastodon.social/@Gargron">@Eugen</a> if he could do it, and literally 5 seconds later he had added the emoji to the list. Thanks!</p>

<p>Fellow Micro.bloggers, if you want to add it to your profile, or use it in conversation, :microblog: is now available! Yay!</p>

         	<p>One of the things I started doing a while back, is write down a few notes about some of the places we visit, when a friend mentions he might be going there. Little travel guides with a couple of photos thrown in. I was using a GitHub Gist for each one of them, and most are in Portuguese, but I&rsquo;m thinking about moving them here as well, and translating the ones in Portuguese. This might be a better place for them&hellip;</p>

<p>One I did (actually it&rsquo;s still a work in progress) in English is <a href="https://gist.github.com/maique/a2c8d96ff903d3425dad6f2cfc80030d">the one about Príncipe</a>, and the bigger island as well, our tiny <em>home away from home</em>.</p>

<p>Should I take the time to port it ?</p>

         	<p>I long time ago I made a bot for the bird network and today I woke up thinking I might port that one to Mastodon. Why ? I&rsquo;m spending more time on that network, and would love to see those quotes showing up from time to time (twice a day, at the moment).</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/f079e6215c.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>They are an inspiration to me, a reminder of what other photographers had to say about photography and life, a daily shot to keep me focused,&hellip; They might do the same for you.
<a href="https://botsin.space/@PhotoQuotes">PhotoQuotes</a></p>

<p>It was really easy to do, as the tracery file was already being used on the other bot.<br />
<a href="https://cheapbotstootsweet.com/">Cheap Bots, Toot Sweet</a> to the rescue, and a new Mastodon handle was registered at <a href="https://botsin.space/">BotsInSpace</a>. A few tweaks later, and the bot was working.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re into photography, or quotes, or both, you can now follow <a href="https://botsin.space/@PhotoQuotes">PhotoQuotes</a> and have those quotes show up on your timeline.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll look for more of them, as the character limit on Mastodon allows for longer ones, and update the bot soon. But there are a lot of them already available.</p>

<p>Feel free to join me and follow this <a href="https://botsin.space/@PhotoQuotes">cute bot</a>.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Yesterday I <a href="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/2020/06/15/i-need-a.html">posted</a> a photo from Kuang Si, and the reactions were so nice I thought about posting a few more. That is a very special place indeed.</p>

<p>From my notes while we were there:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The town is very small, so you’ll search entertainment around it, and entertainment we found. Kuang Si falls are a must see. Really. We were hoping to find yet another waterfall, and were blown by this one. It is an amazing place. The size, the amount of water that comes down the mountain, the fact that you’ll be going up a huge stairway while the water is coming down, the view from the top, everything made this THE waterfall.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/a0bccaa750.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The town is Luang Prabang, Laos.
Two years later that waterfall it’s still one of our fondest memories from the whole trip.<br />
We had arrived in Luang Prabang a couple of days earlier, and our first night was spent at the only hotel we hated on the whole three and a half months of the journey. We stayed at dozens of hotels while on the road, and this was the only time we left the hotel and moved to another one. Luang Prabang was not an instant hit with us.</p>

<p>Our new hotel, thankfully, was a lot nicer, and the staff made it even better. We couldn’t have found a cosier place. We would be even happier a couple of days later, when rain started pouring down, and wouldn&rsquo;t stop for days. We were pretty much stuck inside, and it was great we&rsquo;d found such a nice place. But moving on&hellip;</p>

<p>The town, as I wrote at the time, is really small, and you&rsquo;ll walk from end to end, slowly, in no time. There are plenty of temples to visit, and the market is worth a visit, both during the day and in the evening. Good for a meal too. But this is one stop where we hadn&rsquo;t done our homework, and booked way too many days in town. There are a lot of cafés, and restaurants, but we felt the place overpriced. Very overpriced.</p>

<p>The town&rsquo;s name has a certain ring to it, you start dreaming as soon as you hear it, and we had our hopes really high. UNESCO World Heritage Site. We hadn&rsquo;t been disappointed by a UNESCO site so far&hellip;</p>

<p>Early early morning with the monks, another walk around, another temple, the museum, and you&rsquo;re pretty much done. I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s not worth it, but we were coming from Mandalay, and Chiang-Mai, and Angkor&hellip; You get the picture.</p>

<p>That brings us to the waterfall. As I said, homework not done, we were going on the allure of the name alone, we asked the nice man at the hotel’s reception what he thought would be worth a visit. He immediately said Kuang Si. We briefly pondered if we’d go straight away, or the following day, and decided to just go. Transportation was arranged for an hour later.</p>

<p>(Lucky pick, as the following day a storm arrived, and we couldn&rsquo;t do it anymore.)</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/c820605130.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We were on the road for 30 minutes or so, and got to the <em>ground level</em> at the waterfall. You pay a small fee and go in. The area is bigger than we expected, and we quickly started seeing families having fun and swimming around. It looked nice, but not the big waterfall we expected. We kept walking and realised there are a lot of pools along the way, some shallower, others allowing a small dive from a tree branch or a rock on the edge of the pool, some with faster water flow and out of bounds. It was starting to look like we had come to a very nice place indeed.</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/329f736067.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/c9adff43fa.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We kept walking up the hill. Happy, wet, people were coming down the track. A couple more minutes and we finally found it! <strong>THE</strong> waterfall! It was there, right before our eyes, and it was the most beautiful one we&rsquo;d seen so far. It was magnificent.</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/9029a4aed3.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/ea9c65061b.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We spent a good time gazing at it, getting some photos, taking it all in. This is what we&rsquo;d came here for.<br />
And then we spotted people coming from a little track on the side, so I talked to one of them and asked if there was something else to see. And there was. You&rsquo;d go up a steep stairway and a few minutes of light climbing, and you would reach the top, they said. They pointed to the place where the climb started, and off we went.</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/f34985a594.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>How many times can I write &lsquo;amazing&rsquo; in a post ? Because I feel like writing it in every sentence!
We were very fortunate with the amount of water on that day, as I&rsquo;ve read it&rsquo;s not usual to have so much of it, and waterfalls don&rsquo;t really <em>work</em> without water, right ?<br />
It was cold, and came down fast, it&rsquo;s hard to describe the feeling, we were laughing and smiling all the way up.</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/b6af725e4b.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>When we made it all the way up, the view was spectacular.</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/b8bd0e3aae.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>And a few other pool to try out. We&rsquo;d lost count by then, but you can have a dip in a lot of pools at this place!</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/756ea73e3b.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/2f017434e5.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We dried ourselves, walked all the way down, smiled at the people bathing and just having fun, and stepped outside for a beer (me) and some fresh water (movieStar wife) before heading back to Luang Prabang.</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/c6e4347052.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We had decided to give it another try. Luang Prabang, on the other hand, decided to give us rain. Until the day we left.</p>

<p>On our first visit my mom wouldn’t even hold her, she was unsure what the protocol was, with the pandemic still raging.
This time we talked about it on the way over and, almost as soon as we walked in, the baby was handed to her. To say she was thrilled would be a huge understatement.</p>

<p>It’s their first granddaughter, and my parents waited too long for this. Glad we could do this today.</p>

         	<p>We&rsquo;re not big YouTube users at our place.</p>

<p>We always make sure to watch the usual Colbert/John Oliver/Seth Meyers/Trevor Noah videos but, other than that, there&rsquo;s only one YouTuber, of the <em>classic</em> style, that we follow and make sure we don&rsquo;t miss an episode: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCixD9UbKvDxzGNiPC_fgHyA">Paolo From Tokyo</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/e0bc4c3d1d.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>We do use YouTube, but usually we search for specific things, and we&rsquo;re not subscribers of other users on YouTube. Except for this one. We like him.</p>

<p>When we came back from our <a href="https://maiquemadeira.com/theamazinghoneymoon">Tour of Asia</a>, we went looking for videos about Japan (one of our favorite stops on the trip), and came upon a number of content producers from Tokyo (there are a <strong>LOT</strong> of them!). We wanted to keep <em>living</em> the Japanese dream, and YouTube seemed like a nice way to do it. Somehow Paolo stuck with us, with his huge grin and love of all things Japanese. We binged on his videos for a while, and subscribed. It even felt a bit odd, subscribing to a YouTube feed&hellip;</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/ce72853545.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Paolo has a very nice series called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcpuu5BzmasC7cI-B713EY3xdpWrLhDdH">Day in the Life</a> that showcases the daily lives of a wide range of people, has street food episodes, ones where he reviews whole neighbourhoods, and showed us some <a href="https://www.tokyozebra.com/blog/asakusastreetfood">pancakes</a> that will be our first stop next time we&rsquo;re in Japan. Benitsuru, we&rsquo;re coming for you!
He also makes <a href="https://www.tokyozebra.com/maps">cool maps</a> for some of the episodes, downloadable on his site.</p>

<p>Recently Paolo and his lovely wife Maiko had a baby (Congrats, guys!), a month after our own baby Clara was born, and they made a new YouTube channel more focused on their daily life. It&rsquo;s called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCk8Fs9fhRAZ1KAmbXcGkWjg">Tokyo Zebra</a>, same name as his site. We&rsquo;re already following that one too, it&rsquo;s nice to see how people handle the whole baby stuff on the other side of the world.</p>

<p>All in all, if you’re looking for informative videos about Japan, with high production value, this one is a no-brainer.</p>

<p>You can find Paolo on:</p>

         	<p>I did it! I managed to spend a whole day without buying an app!</p>

<p>Obviously I caved on the second day, and got <a href="http://appmakes.io/paletro">Paletro</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/da60a43f95.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I loved using ⇧⌘P on Sublime Text, and then VS Code, as a quick way to access commands on those apps, wouldn&rsquo;t it be great if this Command Palette was available on all apps ? It would. It is now.</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/0d5f51928d.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>It works beautifully with Drafts, so that would be enough to buy it, but I&rsquo;m happy to report that plenty other apps also get better with Paletro.</p>

<p>The app is fairly priced, and there&rsquo;s a generous 14 day trial period, so you can see if it fits your workflow.</p>

<p>The app is a recent one, so I&rsquo;m waiting for the custom themes (where would we be without custom themes for every app we love?) and maybe some other features, like extensions.</p>

<p>Curious ? Go get it.</p>

<p>Paletro<br />

         	<p>Yesterday I had to visit the dentist, and took advantage of that drive to listen to the <a href="https://overcast.fm/+KxFF8CR4k">latest episode</a> of <a href="http://coreint.org/">Core Intuition</a>.</p>

<p>I’m in love with CarPlay, and that&rsquo;s available only in my brother-in-law&rsquo;s car, not mine, too old for that kind of tech. So I enjoy these rides on a borrowed car a little more. I&rsquo;m a newbie CarPlay user, and I like new things.</p>

<p>I parked close to the dentist’s office and I was doing something on my iPhone while the episode played on. I still had a couple of minutes to spare. I had to screenshot something on the mobile device and was pleasantly surprised to see that it also screenshoots (?) the CarPlay display! Lovely!</p>

         	<p>One year of Micro.blog just started with the new subscription.</p>

<p>While I don&rsquo;t have a lot to say, I&rsquo;m enjoying the flow of posting here, as a sort of life-log. It&rsquo;s great to be able to have a place I can call my own, and write away from the chaos that Twitter can sometimes be, while still having things show up there. Discussion, when it happens, is now at both places.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been <a href="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/2020/05/21/month.html">a month since baby Clara was born</a>, and this first year will surely be a challenging and wonderful one, so I expect a lot of randomness and baby talk to show up here. Sleep deprivation will be one of {micro maique}&rsquo;s fuels, I&rsquo;m sure.</p>

<p>Obviously, a lot of photos will end up here. That&rsquo;s a guarantee. While <a href="https://www.instagram.com/maique/">Instagram</a> remains a must for me (even though I&rsquo;m <a href="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/2020/05/24/ive-had-no.html">not enjoying it as much</a> these days), a lot of the daily photos have no place there, so they&rsquo;ll also be posted here. That&rsquo;s what I do, in the end, photography is my business, as well as an addiction.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m enjoying the tweaking process of my own blog, the amazing help of the community, and the people I&rsquo;ve already connected with on these first weeks on Mb. It&rsquo;s a lovely place to hang out.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Wow! It&rsquo;s been a month. Already. Seems like it went by in a flash but it also seems it took forever.</p>

<p>On one hand I can still vividly remember the moment this tiny creature was born, screaming with her arms open to the world.<br />
On the other one I can&rsquo;t remember the last time we were free to do whatever we wanted.</p>

<p>A month ago we were locked in a hospital room, with a tiny baby girl, unable to go outside even to get coffee from a vending machine (Covid rules), thrilled our baby girl was healthy and perfect.<br />
I hadn&rsquo;t even considered the fact she might not, right up to the moment when she was born. That&rsquo;s when it hit me, and I started frantically looking at her hands and feet, making sure everything was ok. Were the eyes ok ? How about the nose ? Her mouth ? The paediatrician said everything was ok, but I had to check for myself.</p>

<p><strong>That clock had started ticking, there&rsquo;s no stopping that now</strong>.</p>

<p>We spent three days there, in our room, getting busy with an array of doctors, nurses and auxiliary staff, all taking care of us and the baby, teaching us the basics of newborn care. We&rsquo;d done a workshop during the pregnancy, but that fake baby died a couple of times in our hands. No place for those mistakes now&hellip;</p>

<p>As everything was ok by day three, first vaccine already taken and all the tests we could wish for, so we were let go. <strong>It was one of the scariest moments of my life</strong>, and I&rsquo;ve been through a few scary things.
Getting dressed, packing our bags, and leaving to get the car, that&rsquo;s when it dawned on me, again: she&rsquo;s our responsibility. Forever. No taking that back. We have to take care of her, on our own, for the rest of our lives.</p>

<p>I spoke with other dads, and the feeling was the same for them. For nine months, you get you&rsquo;re about to become a dad. You see your wife getting bigger, shopping for the baby, getting the house ready,&hellip; But when she&rsquo;s born, that&rsquo;s when you really, really, get it! No amount of preparation gets us ready for <strong>that</strong> moment!</p>

<p>We came home to our in-laws, where we had already spent the last month and a half of the pregnancy, lockdown from corona virus. We have a ton of support here, so that&rsquo;s easier on us. Help with cooking, help with laundry, help with shopping, help with caring. Plenty of help. More than most people have, and that&rsquo;s a blessing.</p>

<p>All in all, it hasn&rsquo;t been as hard as some people we know that we know and had babies recently made us believe it would be. Every baby is a different baby, they told us, and some are harder, they said. I guess. Clara is pretty mellow, and we expected a heavier load, truth be told.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard to go from doing whatever you want, whenever you want, to having your whole schedule dictated by the baby&rsquo;s needs, but we&rsquo;re getting there, no big issues. That&rsquo;s what we signed up for.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s soooo cool to look at her and notice the way she&rsquo;s changing, slowly, day by day. The way she couldn&rsquo;t see properly on the first days and now she looks at you and it seems she already recognise us. Every thing about her is coated in extra sweetness. The way she moves her arms, the way she makes tiny fists and shakes them about when she&rsquo;s waking up, the surprised look when we&rsquo;re changing her diaper&hellip;</p>

<p>Changing diapers is my new thing, by the way, so far it&rsquo;s not heavy duty. And I love bath days and they way she loves the warm water.</p>

<p>Sleeping has been an issue though, we have a night owl with us. She loves sleeping in but, as soon as night falls, she&rsquo;s awake. When she does fall asleep, the scary noises start, and I&rsquo;m wide awake by then, afraid something will happen and I won&rsquo;t notice! When I do sleep is because I&rsquo;m completely exhausted and just fall down.</p>

<p>But that&rsquo;s it. She doesn&rsquo;t even cry that much, she&rsquo;s as sweet as babies come, and the most beautiful one I&rsquo;ve seen. I know, I know, I shouldn&rsquo;t be the one saying this, but she is.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m double lucky to have all of this with my wife, my movieStar. We&rsquo;ve had an amazing time before the baby was born, a wedding that was a dream, the most amazing honeymoon imaginable, and everything that led up to this moment has been an absolute pleasure. She is, simply, the best!</p>

<p>Long live movieStar, and long live tinyMovieStar! ❤️</p>

         	<p>Why <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> ?</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/9d914ba1a6.png" alt="micro" /></p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago I wrote a <a href="https://xanato.net/blog/drafts/">post</a> about <a href="https://getdrafts.com">Drafts</a> on <a href="https://xanato.net">xanatoNet</a>.<br />
That got me thinking about blogging again, and I started looking for an alternative to the Jekyll install on GitHub Pages I was using.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t really have that much to say but, when I feel like writing something and sharing it, the whole write - insert YAML - upload to a GitHub repo was getting a bit too much work. If I had photos or screenshots to go with it, even worse.</p>

<p>The apps for that whole thing are available, and they do the job brilliantly, but it&rsquo;s just too much for the simple needs I have.</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/163fdf5b17.png" alt="drafts" /></p>

<p>As I do most of my writing on Drafts, I went looking for blogging actions I could use. Soon I was looking at the <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/search?utf8=✓&amp;q=Micro.blog">actions available for Micro.blog</a>.</p>

<p>I hadn&rsquo;t thought about this service for a long time, maybe it was time to give it a second look and create an account.</p>

<p>At first I tried skipping the paid account (sorry for that, <a href="https://micro.blog/manton">@manton</a>) and go at it with a Wordpress being imported into my micro.blog. I did that for two days, and then decided to embrace the whole idea of the site, and handed over the money for a year. Why ? A few reasons.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I kept looking for a way to post from macOS and iOS, on the fly, quickly. That&rsquo;s all I really wanted: no hassle.</p></li>

<li><p>I wanted to keep a blog, but didn&rsquo;t want to deal with installing and maintaining software.</p></li>

<li><p>I wanted to use a markdown editor and type a few words and be done with it. It&rsquo;s just text, dealing with a blogging app like Wordpress felt like too much trouble.</p></li>

<li><p>I wanted to be free from categories, tags, themes, and all the mess that usually comes with blogging.</p></li>

<li><p>I wanted to get away from Jekyll YAML and pushing code to a GitHub repo.</p></li>

<li><p>I wanted things to be <strong>easy</strong>.</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Micro.blog is&hellip;</p>

<ol>
<li>The fastest way to blog.</li>
<li>A safe community for microblogs.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Micro.blog is all those things, and more. I get my own micro.blog domain, and I can map one of my own (I did). I get an app (iOS and macOS) where I can quickly type some silly things, maybe add a photo, and press a button.</p>

<p>The community around it seems really nice and helpful too.</p>

<p>And&hellip; emoji!! They really <a href="https://help.micro.blog/2018/tagmoji/">love</a> <a href="https://manton.micro.blog/2018/01/09/books-on-microblog.html">emoji</a> at micro.blog!</p>

<p>Topping it all, I can still use a <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1Dj">Drafts action</a> to write all my stuff (at least the ones that don&rsquo;t need a photo). Just type and press a button.
If a photo is required, I&rsquo;ll just upload it and grab the link or, more often, use an app.</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/3b363ce41e.png" alt="gluon" /></p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re not into Drafts, or want to try something other than what Micro.blog offers, you can pick from a number of <a href="https://help.micro.blog/2017/micropub-clients/">third-party apps</a> available. When I need to post a photo I&rsquo;m a fan of <a href="https://gluon.app">Gluon</a>. Also using it to browse the network on the iPhone.</p>

<p>The micro posts I share over there get crossposted to Twitter, no need to do that myself. Sometimes the follow-up conversation happens on that network, others on Micro.blog.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://help.micro.blog">help pages</a> have an answer for all the questions you might ask.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m happy. If you&rsquo;re looking for something similar, check them out.</p>

<p>Picked a theme, tweaked the color, made an <a href="https://maique.micro.blog/about/">About</a> page, checked to see if it was being crossposted to Twitter (it is) and, bam, it&rsquo;s 6AM!</p>

<p>All of this on mobile, still no need for a desktop!</p>

<p>Posts (and pages) done on my trusty <a href="https://getdrafts.com">Drafts</a>.</p>

<p>Now&hellip; should I transfer the <a href="https://xanato.net">xanatoNet</a> domain and start using it here ? The poor thing has been through so many blogging platforms, one more wouldn&rsquo;t hurt, would it ?</p>

<h2 id="drafts-again-maybe-forever">Drafts, again, maybe forever ?</h2>

<p>A couple of weeks ago I got back into the <a href="https://getdrafts.com">Drafts</a> train. I&rsquo;d been a user, on and off, for years, but always found myself stepping off and using other apps for my note taking. I&rsquo;ve used the usual suspects, Notes.app, Bear, &hellip;</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/f77e91d678.jpg" alt="ready" /></p>

<p>This time around, locked in a hospital room, waiting for my first child (baby girl, thank you very much), I had time to start digging in, and try to find other uses for it. And I did. Turns out I found a few.</p>

<h3 id="pro-subscription">Pro subscription</h3>

<p>First thing I did was find an excuse to subscribe to the <a href="https://docs.getdrafts.com/draftspro">Pro tier</a>. An icon sealed that deal. I NEEDED that classic Mac icon!</p>

<p>Soon I found myself using other Pro features: Themes, Workspaces (amazing) and editing actions to better suit me. But I didn&rsquo;t have to. I wouldn&rsquo;t really need these.</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/e898206777.jpg" alt="workspaces" /></p>

<p>Supporting development is the main reason you should pay, even though the app feels Pro on the free tier. It does a LOT without the extra features. Most actions don&rsquo;t need editing to work for you, workspaces are really nice to have, but only needed if you find yourself using it all day, for everything (by then you should be paying something anyway), and the theme selection is still far from perfect (Nord theme maybe coming ??).</p>

<p>Moving on, what am I using it for ?</p>

<p>A few of the things that now live on my Drafts:</p>

<h3 id="notes-duh">Notes. Duh.</h3>

<p><strong>Note taking</strong>, let&rsquo;s get this one out of the way first.
I love taking notes, small bits all day long; and I love doing it in <a href="https://larsenwork.com/monoid/">Monoid</a>. Turns out Drafts is really good for note taking and you can pick from one of the included fonts, or install your own.</p>

<p><strong>Clarinha Diary</strong>: write something down real quick about the baby, press a button, it gets added to a running note, complete with date and time. When the day ends, I just paste that note into Day One, where a more complete journal is being written, with photos.</p>

<h3 id="get-your-tweet-on">Get your Tweet on!</h3>

<p><strong>Twitter</strong>! I found out I love to tweet from Drafts, and I&rsquo;m not talking about an action to send the draft to <a href="https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/">Tweetbot</a>. Just using plain old simple Twitter, from inside Drafts. The tweet gets published and I&rsquo;m not spending another minute, or hour, going down my timeline.
You can, of course, use Drafts to send your text to Tweetbot, or Twitterrific, but this is the one working for me.</p>

<p>Actions:<br />
| <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1E5">Tweet</a><br />
| <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1CT">Tweet with Tweetbot</a><br />
| <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1CU">Tweet with Twitterrific</a></p>

<h3 id="out-shopping">Out Shopping</h3>

<p><strong>Shopping List</strong>. I&rsquo;m a big <a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a> fan, and use it for all my task needs. I have dozens of personal and professional projects going on, all neatly organised in Things.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s where my shopping list also lives. That was pre-Covid, when I could freely unlock my phone when out in the supermarket. Not anymore. Wearing a mask makes this an excruciatingly hard exercise, and I found myself thinking there had to be a better way. Turns out it does.</p>

<p>Drafts to the rescue. The shopping mode keeps the screen on the whole time, and the keyboard is disabled. I can get my phone in and out of my pocket as many times as I wish, it&rsquo;s always on. Perfect.</p>

<p>Action:<br />
| <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1OR">Toggle Shopping Mode</a></p>

<h3 id="scheduling-stuff">Scheduling stuff</h3>

<p><strong>Calendar</strong>. Inputting stuff into <a href="https://flexibits.com/fantastical">Fantastical</a>. It now feels weird to go into Fantastical to add an event, even though that&rsquo;s also an easy task. But I&rsquo;m so used to opening Drafts when I unlock my phone, I&rsquo;ll just write it down and add it to Fantastical from there. Even nicer when I have multiple events to add. You&rsquo;ll see.</p>

<p>Actions:<br />
| <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1CM">Event in Fantastical</a><br />
| <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1ED">Events in Fantastical</a><br />
| <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1Lk">Fantastically Good Event Parser</a></p>

<h3 id="tasks-galore">Tasks galore</h3>

<p><strong>Tasks</strong>. Same workflow for Things. Drafts is now the place where I write down what i need to do, and then these tasks are sent to Things.</p>

<p>Action:<br />
| <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1CO">Task in Things</a></p>

<h3 id="email-that-for-me-will-you">Email that for me, will you?</h3>

<p>Writing Rich Text emails in Markdown and sending them on their way with <a href="https://sparkmailapp.com">Spark</a>. Easier to format text this way.</p>

<p>Actions:<br />
| <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1J3">Email (Spark)</a><br />
| <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1JR">Email - Spark (Markdown)</a></p>

<h3 id="are-you-talking-to-me">Are you talking to me?</h3>

<p><strong>Messaging</strong>. <a href="https://telegram.org">Telegram</a>/<a href="https://www.whatsapp.com">WhatsApp</a>. For quick replies I&rsquo;ll go into these apps and write on the appropriate chat. If I&rsquo;m preparing a longer text, I find it more convenient to write it down on Drafts.
That&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve found very comfortable for a lot of apps: writing down stuff away from the app where it&rsquo;ll end up. It&rsquo;s easier for me to focus on the thing I&rsquo;m writing if it&rsquo;s just a black screen with no distractions from the app.<br />
The Telegram action wasn&rsquo;t available and it was well within my level of expertise to make one, so I did.</p>

<p>Actions:<br />
| <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/18E">Send to Telegram</a><br />
| <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1HN">Send to WhatsApp</a></p>

<h2 id="extra-things">Extra things</h2>

<h3 id="you-can-quote-me-on-that">You can quote me on that</h3>

<p><strong>Quote repository</strong>. Workspaces are great for this. They keep my inbox clean, and make it easy to find stuff when I need it. Tag support is great on Drafts, if you tag your notes, it&rsquo;s super easy to have them automatically organised in Workspaces.</p>

<h3 id="snip-snip">Snip snip</h3>

<p><strong>Snippet vault</strong>. Same goes for snippets. <a href="https://tot.rocks">Tot</a> is a great app for snippets with a short expiration date, Drafts is used to keep the ones that&rsquo;ll live longer, like hashtag bundles for Instagram&hellip;</p>

<h3 id="my-wife-is-a-hoot">My Wife is a hoot</h3>

<p><strong>Wife Sleepy Craziness</strong>. My wife sometimes says the craziest things while sleeping. Some of the most hilarious sentences I&rsquo;ve heard. This is where they live.</p>

<h3 id="meta-action">Meta action.</h3>

<p>One of the things I felt I needed when writing, is a notes file for the note I&rsquo;m writing. I know, I know&hellip;.
Obviously someone had thought about that already (thanks, @agiletortoise, again) and I can now press a button and go back and forth between the note I&rsquo;m writing and the notes for that note. Helpful as hell.</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/4dbe334d70.jpg" alt="meta" /></p>

<p>Action:<br />
| <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/17w">Meta Data &lt; &gt; Draft</a></p>

<h3 id="github-gist">GitHub Gist</h3>

<p>Even though I&rsquo;m not a developer, I like to use <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>. I host this blog on <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a> and I use <a href="https://gist.github.com">GitHub Gist</a> to share stuff with friends. I make small travel guides with tips for my friends, and post them there, or small tutorials when another friend needs help with something and I feel I can help.
I used Sublime Text to compose these, and then upload them to Gist. There had to be a way to do this with Drafts, so why not change my workflow?
Turns out the action to do that was outdated, not working. A quick trip to the <a href="https://forums.getdrafts.com">forum</a>, and @agiletortoise came through, yet again, updating the action in no time. Isn&rsquo;t that the greatest customer support ever?</p>

<p>Action:<br />
| <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/18O">Post Gist to Github</a></p>

<h2 id="edit-09-05-2020">Edit 09-05-2020</h2>

<p>I forgot a couple of things, so I&rsquo;ll just add them here. More coming in the future, I&rsquo;m sure, as this app is so cool it feels like having a new phone, and I keep finding new stuff I can get accomplished with it.</p>

<h3 id="blogging-still">Blogging, still</h3>

<p>One of the things I do, on and off (mostly off these days) is blogging. Sometimes I write down something and post it, that&rsquo;s it. It&rsquo;s mainly for myself, my readership levels should not even make it to two digits, but I like to do it, from time to time.</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/d4bc47a683.jpg" alt="blog" /></p>

<p>Longer posts go into a <a href="https://medium.com/making-of-maiquemadeira">Medium publication</a> that lies dormant most of the year, and other stuff I publish on this <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> install hosted on GitHub Pages. It was set up mainly as a proof-of-concept, when I was looking for ways to use GitHub as a non-developer, and I remember I have it here, ready to post, from time to time.</p>

<h3 id="can-you-hear-me">Can you hear me?</h3>

<p>Dictation is not the first thing that comes to mind when I&rsquo;m writing, but maybe it should!</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/b3d8922127.jpg" alt="dict" /></p>

<p>I never got into the habit of talking to my iPhone, but Drafts does that really well. I started getting into it now that one of my hands is usually holding a baby, and I&rsquo;m forced to write with the other one. The size of the iPhone is not well suited for that, so I started using this feature more often. Press a button on the extra keyboard row, say a few things, and most of it is usually write. A few tweaks and it&rsquo;s ready to go.</p>

<p>I can keep on talking for as long as I want to, it never goes into sleep mode, and I can do it in English and Portuguese. Maybe I&rsquo;ll even stop hating the way my voice sounds!</p>

<h3 id="note">Note</h3>

<p>Most actions I&rsquo;ve posted are the <em>official</em> ones, made by <a href="http://twitter.com/agiletortoise">@agiletortoise</a>. There are countless variations, some with a huge amount of extra features. You should try them out if you feel you need something more than the stock features.
Most of them are already included on the action groups that are installed by default, so you don&rsquo;t even need to download them, unless you&rsquo;ve deleted them in the meantime.</p>

<p>Browse the <a href="https://actions.getdrafts.com">Drafts Directory</a> and I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll find dozens that fit your needs.</p>

<p>Try it. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll love it.<br />

I&rsquo;ll leave Squarespace and move my domain to Adobe Portfolio. I don&rsquo;t really use Squarespace&rsquo;s multitude of features, and Adobe Portfolio is included with the plan I&rsquo;m subscribed to.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to find the time to take care of the whole moving process, but I keep getting derailed. Still a couple of months left on my Squarespace plan, but I really need to start getting things done.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a long way to the end, but today I went at it again, and working on a new gallery: theAmazingHoneymoon. A ton of photos to upload, and some of the ones already there will probably be taken down before it&rsquo;s ready.<br />
Anyway, if you&rsquo;d like to take a look, feel free to <a href="https://maique.myportfolio.com/theamazinghoneymoon">visit</a> and let me know what you think about it.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t miss Wordpress a bit. Not a tiny little bit. And now I&rsquo;m stuck with it again, trying to help out.<br />
Every single tweak requires a trip to Duckduckgo, or Stack Overflow, or reddit, seaching for a piece of CSS that needs to be included so the site will behave as expected. Need a taller header ? CSS. Need a non-round logo ? CSS. Need a wider area text ? CSS.</p>

<p>Sadly the free plan still doesn&rsquo;t allow GitHub Pages on private repositories and, as far as I can see, also no free private repositories on organizations.</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t need those now it&rsquo;s a good time to downgrade your account, or simply open an account if you were thinking about it but needed the free repositories.</p>

         	<p>One of the nice things about Linux is that I&rsquo;m finding a ton of new applications.<br />
Some are big, stuff you can use instead of those apps you&rsquo;re used to in MacOS or Windows, and some are smaller things that make Linux fun to use.</p>

<p>This post is about three of them, of the smaller ones, but ones that work so nice together it feels they were made by the same person.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a Twitter app, a Terminal app and a sound effects thingy (??).</p>

<p>One of the things most people fear when they think about Linux is the time they&rsquo;ll have to spend using terminal, instead of the usual point and click applications we&rsquo;ve grown so used to.<br />
After using Linux for a while now, I can tell you the time you&rsquo;ll spend using terminal is not really that much time, unless you want to.<br />
I would guess the initial period would be the most terminal-heavy, since you&rsquo;re installing and configuring stuff, but even then it&rsquo;s down to a minimal, if you pick a distro that won&rsquo;t force you to go into terminal mode.</p>

<p><img src="https://micro.maiquemadeira.com/uploads/2020/09bfade966.jpg" alt="retro" /></p>

<p>Anyway&hellip; Being old school, I love me some terminal. Other people seem to love it too, so there&rsquo;s a cool old school terminal emulator. And also a twitter app that is terminal-only. The only thing missing was the cool sound of the older keyboards, but someone else thought about this too!</p>

<p>Turns out you can use Twitter in a retro terminal, complete with the clickity clack of the old IBM we had at school! Love it! It&rsquo; just a matter of installing the following apps:</p>

It can, it is, a bit too much. Personally I would be willing to buy more stuff if they loosened up a bit. But it is what it is, and they’re not changing.

You can take a bus, but driving in Morocco is another experience you can’t miss. It takes hours to get anywhere, as the distances are always huge and speed limits are very much enforced by the always present gendarmerie. They have radars all along the country’s roads, and will make sure you’re fined if you step over the limit. But the scenery is superb, the landscape rolling by feels like a movie, and crawling along the main street of the towns you cross fills that movie with thousands of extras going about their lives.</p></div>

We got to a part of the road that was straighter and took that opportunity to take over the truck. All four of us. Of course there was a police patrol watching the whole thing, and we were all told to stop the cars on the side of the road. One by one we were called to the squad car, to deal with the fine payment. 400 dirhams, that was the sum we’d have to fork over. When my time arrived, I took the money from my pocket and handed it over to the agent, sitting on his car. The moroccan drivers already left the scene. As the agent picked up the receipt book, he spoke… ‘Expensive ?’ Hmmm, I thought, the door has been opened for ‘negotiation’. ‘Yes, very expensive’ I replied, waiting for the alternative sum. It was not my first dance with the local police, and ready to dance I was. He just looked at me, kindly warned me to be a little more careful next time, and handed over the money. All of it. All. I almost felt like kissing him, but instead got into the car and drove away. Happy.</p>

We met a couple of them that showed real concern about us getting hurt, and offered Sintra and Cascais as viable alternatives for the foreigners: ‘Nicer photos over there.’</p>

<p name="7aad" id="7aad" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">All along the years I’ve spent at the paper there’s been a constant in the photojournalism market around these parts: this is not a country for freelancing.</p>
<p name="923e" id="923e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’ve said it time after time to the interns we’ve had over the years. And I’ve seen their careers stall when they are forced to pick the freelancing way.</p>
<p name="0be3" id="0be3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Newspapers and news magazines have always relied on staff photographers and, up to a few years ago, freelancing was close to non-existent in the country. Photographers were employed by the media organisations, and left their jobs for another publication. Most news outlets have contracts with international agencies (Reuters, AP and AFP) for their world news needs and there’s also a national news agency that has an extensive network of correspondents, both in the country and abroad.</p>
<p name="7bb4" id="7bb4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There were a couple (really, I guess the number is actually around two) <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">established</em> freelance photojournalists, but they struggled. Rates in the country are just too low. And most newspapers and magazines had enough people on staff to cover all the news they needed anyway. And then things changed. People started getting fired, newsrooms were slimming down, rapidly. Pages still needed photos, websites more so, the newspapers started hiring freelancers (sometimes the ones they’d just fired) for those times when the shrinking photo desks couldn’t handle the workload anymore.</p>
<p name="215d" id="215d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The budget for these freelancers, however, is still very low. Day rates are miserable in most places, as I’ve said, and the ones that still pay a <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">normal</em> fee are forced to cut down on assignments outsourced to freelancers even further. Most photographers have to do other stuff as well. A lot have gone into wedding photography and are responsible for the amazing quality we now have on that particular field. Others have found different ways to support themselves while trying to be photojournalists. Some teach, some organise workshops, some do stuff that is in no way related to photojournalism.</p>

<div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn">
<p name="b05e" id="b05e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">About a week ago I decided to jump ship on the most perfect job ever. My job. I’d been working there for close to twenty years.</p>
<h4 name="3770" id="3770" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">01. Before</h4>
<p name="fb61" id="fb61" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Growing up I can remember wanting to be a Systems Engineer. That’s where my studies were leading to. Things didn’t turn out that way (another blog post, maybe?) and, as I discovered photography, I knew I’d found a new goal in life.</p>
<p name="95e8" id="95e8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My mind made up, I went to <a href="http://arco.pt/site/" data-href="http://arco.pt/site/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">photo school</a>. The student body at the time was made up of mostly two groups: the artist wannabes and the photojournalist wannabes. I quickly joined the photojournalism group, as they seemed the most fun to be around, and soon enough I also knew where I wanted to work when school was done: the job I just left.</p>
<p name="a6f6" id="a6f6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Went through photo school, tried to find an internship at the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">dream place</em>, failed to do that, ended up doing my internship (7 months, no pay) at another newspaper (the competition). It was not the best of times, but I learned a lot there, met a ton of people who would play important roles for years to come, worked my butt off, made Staff Photographer, and waited until someone responsible at the dream paper noticed my work.</p>
<h4 name="1ad2" id="1ad2" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">02. During</h4>
<p name="45f2" id="45f2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">At the time there were a lot of magazines and newspapers around, and new ones popped up every once in a while. People moved from place to place with relative ease, and three years later an opportunity presented itself: there was a new paper in town, and a couple of photographers were leaving the dream place and moving there. I, it turned out, was considered for a position by the new editor. I, it turned out, moved to the dream place after three years at my first paper. I was 27 years old, there was no other place on earth I’d rather be. There was also no other place to go. This was it.</p>
<p name="0f51" id="0f51" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The Photo Desk at this newspaper was epic, all of them masters of the trade. They were always covering stories most photographers in the country could only dream about, there was always money around to go on cool assignments. We were much bigger than our country, where no one seems to read a newspaper unless it a crappy one, or a sports paper.</p>
<p name="dcbe" id="dcbe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A few months went by and I was sent on assignment to Kosovo! Kosovo! I’d gotten as far as Madrid on the other paper! A year later I would be developing film in a bathroom in East-Timor. The following nineteen years would be a roller coaster ride, as they say, with a lot of good stories, a ton of good friends, everything I could have wished for. My dream life was coming true, every single day.</p>
<p name="d3f4" id="d3f4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is the place where I would grow, as a person and as a photographer. I wouldn’t be the same one if I’d spent the last twenty years somewhere else.</p>
<p name="e0e4" id="e0e4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And where did I find myself after those twenty years ? Stuck to a desk most of the year, editor for longer than I can remember, spending most of my days looking at other people’s photos instead of my own. I was not as happy as I could be, that’s for sure. I would still get the occasional assignment, but those were far apart and had been getting shorter for a while now. Things have also been different for a while now, even at the dream place.</p>
<h4 name="5d8b" id="5d8b" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">03. After</h4>
<p name="0854" id="0854" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Close to the end of last year we were told by the management that some more cuts would have to be made. We’d been here before, sadly a few times over the years. It’s not a good place to be. This time around a generous severance package was being offered to those who would volunteer. I volunteered.</p>
<p name="1ad6" id="1ad6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I now find myself in the freelancing position. As I will surely have a lot of extra time on my hands (<a href="https://medium.com/@maique/no-country-for-freelancers-49c7c221f850#.5dy8etnw8" data-href="https://medium.com/@maique/no-country-for-freelancers-49c7c221f850#.5dy8etnw8" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank">No Country For Freelancers</a>), I thought about blogging again. I will try to keep things separate, the extra geekiness contained at <a href="https://guezota.com/" data-href="https://guezota.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Guezota Diaries</a> and the day-to-day life of the unemployed photographer at <a href="https://chevalierdubois.com/" data-href="https://chevalierdubois.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Chevalier du Bois</a>. I plan to share stories about the projects I’ll hopefully get off the ground, as well as stuff about the twenty-something years it took me to get here. These were really cool times, going from film to digital and from paper to online, and I was lucky to be able to live them. Very lucky.</p>

<p name="6157" id="6157" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I don’t feel I’m anything but average when it comes to workload, I do more than some people, and a lot less than others, I’m sure. But keeping track of the things I have to to for work, with it’s multiple projects at the same time, as well as helping me manage my personal life at home and everything that has to be done on the web is a monster task, one that Todoist excels at.</p>

Of course you can still use Todoist as a basic list of stuff you have to do and be done with it.

I can definitely recommend going the Premium way. It’s not expensive and adds a ton of features to an already complete package.</p>
<p name="f13e" id="f13e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">How do I use comments and files ? I get an email regarding something I’ll have to deal in a month’s time. I’ll create a task, and add all relevant information as comments. URL, pdf files with portfolios, phone numbers, email contacts, whatever. I then forget about all of these. When the day comes I don’t have to look for that information in a thousand scattered places.</p>
<p name="1520" id="1520" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Or you’re doing a list of stuff you need to get from a store you’re visiting in real life. You can add a photo of the item, along with the URL of the item on the company’s site, on each item’s comments. Handy.</p>
<p name="c4e3" id="c4e3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Files can be uploaded from your computer, or from Dropbox and Google Drive.</p>

They seem to be selling exactly the same items too. It’s one of those places you expect to be long gone, driven to bankruptcy in one of the many financial crisis we’ve had in the country since then. Not sure how they manage to stay in business, but we did find what we were looking for.</p></div>

There’s no X-Ray machine either, so inspection is done by hand. It takes little time, since there’s only 18 of us per flight, and we were instructed to carry a small bag only. All aboard, and thirty minutes later we land in São Tomé. It’s… surprise… raining.</p></div>

He set up a table by the pool deck, and we stuffed ourselves. I ate another ton of fish, octopus, and a lot of raw stuff. Not the usual me. I loved it. Also worth noting that Omali’s chocolate mousse is indeed the best in the world.</p>

<p name="6463" id="6463" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">Twenty years ago I got my first tattoo. It was a small black thing on my leg, one that’s long gone by now, covered by a much larger piece since then. At the time I did it in black and liked it a lot. Then I got a second one, also in black. Soon I had decided all of my tattoos would be black, I couldn’t (don’t ask me why) imagine colour on my skin.</p>

<figcaption class="imageCaption">Left leg ? Sure. At Nobre Tattoo</figcaption></figure><p name="8a21" id="8a21" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Years later we took care of a leg, also black. Part of the other arm was added later, black too. And then I stopped. For a decade, no new tattoos. No idea why none were made during that time, it just happened that way. I would go by the studio from time to time, just to check on them, but never got the urge to do another one.</p>
<p name="b19c" id="b19c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This year, though, while in Thailand with theLovelyWife, I wanted a Sak Yant, and we went and met Ajarn Neng, who was <a href="https://medium.com/sanuk-tour/sak-yant-cf6e1b64da3c" data-href="https://medium.com/sanuk-tour/sak-yant-cf6e1b64da3c" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank">kind enough to do it</a>.</p>
<p name="bcfb" id="bcfb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Just like that, a line was crossed. Someone else had tattooed me. And it also got me thinking about doing more. Thailand jumpstarted the whole tattoo thing again.</p>
<p name="3a0e" id="3a0e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We came back home, as one sadly does, and I went to the studio, showing off the Thai work. There was also another small piece that I would like to cover and we started working on that. My leg is getting (still ongoing), a lot more black.</p>
<p name="b49c" id="b49c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One fine day, while talking tattoos with theLovelyWife she made a comment about color and the fact that I had none. I was left wondering about it. And a couple of days later an intern at work showed me some one he had done a few days earlier. A friend of his, new in town, is doing cool traditional stuff and he done a couple on him. I looked into it and the idea was growing on my mind. I could get some color and, at the same time, a traditional piece. I had none of those too.</p>

<figcaption class="imageCaption">Chiang Mai loveProject</figcaption></figure><p name="a059" id="a059" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">To make the trip up to Chiag Mai, we would need to get back to Sukhothai, not the Old one where we were staying, and then all the way back to Phitsanuluk, before boarding our train to Chiang Mai, where we would arrive around dinner time. It would be a full day of travelling, but we had what seemed like a good place at the end of the day so we were cool about that. The only thing that needed solving, and we had tried, was the first bus.</p>
<p name="747b" id="747b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We had walked around the previous day, trying to figure out where the buses stopped in Old Sukhothai. That old-falling-apart one would do, or even a Mini-van. Something to get us back to a city, a big one. But, for the first time, we’d had some trouble with it, people did not speak a lot of english (read close to nothing) and didn’t seem all that interested in trying to help us. Maybe it was the time of day (we understood that someone was missing at all the places we tried), or maybe it was something else, but we woke up that morning with no clue about that bus. Not too worried because in the end you can always find someone to drive you anywhere, albeit for a price.</p>
<p name="daf7" id="daf7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Packed our bags, had another go at the coconut pudding, said goodbye to Paolo, and asked him to call us a tuk-tuk to drive us to that only road in town, about one km down the road from the guesthouse. My backpack was really heavy and I was in no mood to start the day sweaty from that walk.</p>
<p name="c02d" id="c02d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The tuk-tuk showed up promptly, we loaded our bags and, a couple of minutes later the driver was dropping us off near a huge bus, of the VIP kind. This was one of the places where we had tried to get information the day before, a store that had a sign stating it was a bus stop. However this was the first time we actually saw a bus there. We tried again, with a different person and were told the bus to Sukhothai would show up briefly, maybe 15 minutes. Ok, we could deal with that. We lit a cigarette.</p>

We boarded, even before the end of the cigarette! It would save us another bus, and we would be travelling in style. We were also the only two passengers on that double decker.</p>

Dropped the big packs at the luggage depot, and walked out of there, to explore the town. A 7-Eleven stop later (thank you for Slurpees), and a brief stop at the market and we (well, I) needed some food. We moved back to the station, walked past an amulet market that’s going on in there, and saw a guy eating what looked like a delicious dish. It had a lot of chillies on top of rice and chicken. My kind of lunch. Walked to the lady selling food, pointed to the dish he was having, and I was served one of the tastiest meals so far. Had a Coke with it and payed 45 baht. A little over a euro. I was set till dinner time.</p>

Good for us.<br>One of the drivers talked to us, we told him where we wanted to go, agreed on the price and waited for the thing to fill up with other tourists. It was a short wait.

You can tell the family that runs the place is really proud of their guesthouse, and with good reason. The place looks like something from a design magazine, it has a small pool, and a little balcony with two tables facing the street, ideal for a stop while people watching. Rooms have balconies too, ours was small but big enough for a smoke.<br>When we go back to Chiang Mai, we’re staying there again, for sure.</p>

You make your way through the throng of tourists dumped by dozens of buses, into the tunnel made by the stalls, past the children dressed in ethnic garb that know only one word of english (‘Money’), up the hundreds of stairs and you’re there. Enjoy. It’s still a wonderful place and if you’re lucky and there’s no fog in the air, the views are amazing.</p>
<p name="c1fb" id="c1fb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The road up the mountain can be tricky though, you should drive with extra care. On the day after we went up there a local pickup slid off the road and plunged into the abyss. Not nice at all. If you’re feeling the stress of driving on a mountain road, or even if you’re not, you can stop along the way. There’s a viewpoint on the way up where you should be able to get a bird’s eye view of Chiang Mai, weather permitting.</p>

Yes, there’s a panda, actually a couple of them, but they might be hard to see, as they sleep a lot. And the rest of the zoo is just one sad animal after another, visitors feeding them non-stop and, as soon as there’s a break in the feeding frenzy, the animals start acting like junkies, furiously pacing back and forth, waiting for the next fix. I’m not an expert on wild animal care, but we left with a strong suspicion that some of this behaviour is probably abuse. We were sick about this, and left the place much faster than we had expected.</p>

<figcaption class="imageCaption">Wats galore</figcaption></figure><p name="7420" id="7420" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">If you feel that you should visit a wat (or ten), Chiang Mai has you covered. We went to Wat Phan Tao, Wat Chedi Luang Varavihara, Wat Phra Sing Waramahavihan, Wat Phakhao and a lot of others. They’re all amazing, but we do have a thing for wats. On Chedi Luang I got my first monk offered bracelet, the white skinny ones. I was following a monk around the temple, as I do, trying to get a decent photo, and he sat down in a huge chair and started fiddling with a huge roll of string.. As I positioned myself for the shot, he invited me to kneel in front of me, and made a bracelet. Wrapped it around my wrist, and said a prayer while he doused me with water. The camera survived, and I was a different man.</p>

I had to visit this other one, since I had promised I would on Instagram. Instagram is big in Thailand (really really big) and, as soon as you start adding Thai-related hashtags to your photos, you’ll start getting local followers. Another cool way to find out about spots for a visit. Graph Café, even though it’s very small, is a place made for Instagram. It’s a tiny room on a corner, but what a lovely tiny room it is.</p>

They have a lot of vintage cameras on wooden cabinets, black and white photos on their walls, old school coffee machine and the sweetest barista you can meet in town. He seemed really thrilled to meet us, we spent a few minutes with him, posted a shot on Instagram and traded tips and tricks. I guess that’s what photographers do. The cherry on top of this was that one of the cameras on display was my first camera, the one my father used to shoot with, passed down to me: a Canon AE1.</p>

The full moon was getting close, and it was impossible to get a plane to Ranong, the city where we’d have to get on a boat to the island. All the seats on all the flights out of Bangkok were taken by people going to Koh Phangan, where the famous full moon party takes place, and we had to wait it out.<br>Not a problem as the good people at Sri Pat managed to secure our room for an extra night, and there’s no better place to spend an extra night than Chiang Mai. Heck, we could probably spend the rest of our lives here.</p></div>

Period. It was the coolest music festival around. We didn’t even care about that year’s lineup, we just felt <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/maique/sets/72157624414455807/" data-href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/maique/sets/72157624414455807/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">we had to be there</a>. There was no point in knowing the names, in the end. We didn’t know most of them anyway, not before watching the shows. No big bands, just people who are stars for a smaller crowd. People from all over the world, singing and playing all sorts of instruments and musical genres. All of this taking place inside a castle, with mint all over the floor. The smell of weed mixing with it in the air, as people stepped on the leaves. It was really nice. Lots of families too.</p></div>

I get a feeling that the bands are not as cool, but I might be very wrong, as it often happens. And weed, although still very much a presence, is being challenged by wine, and no good can come of that. The people attending are different. Or maybe it’s just me.</p>
<p name="4139" id="4139" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Also, less families. Oh! And no mint.</p>
<p name="3e36" id="3e36" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The yearly pilgramage is still on, but now for different reasons. It’s an excelent excuse to get out of town and spend a couple of days on the Alentejo coast, the nicest we have in the country, as far as I’m concerned. Maybe we’ll watch the concerts later, but that’s not the point anymore. Maybe we’ll just have dinner on some restaurant by the coast, further down, and be back late or even tired from a whole day roaming the coast. The music is not that important anymore.</p>
<p name="8686" id="8686" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We took off, and this is a bit of what we’ve seen. Not a lot of music, but a load of other cool stuff.</p>

That’s it.</p>
<p name="128c" id="128c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On it a load of books, and the mandatory summer read.

After getting through the first one, I got the second one and took it with me on the trip. It felt perfect. The coastline reminded me of his adventures on the Italian coast, and we had the misfortune of having both our cars on the shop, and as such the whole trip was made on dad’s micro-jeep on loan. It tops at 80 Km/h, so it was as fast as a Vespa. Magical ? Maybe too strong, but it surely was interesting.</p>

<p name="eab9" id="eab9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Super location, amazing interior design, and a very professional service from heavily tattooed barbers who did their training back in the States.

Tried getting a ride with Uber. They launched in town a couple of weeks ago, and I’ve been trying to test the service ever since, but the waiting time I get on the app is just plain silly. I still have the launch day free rides to use, so that would be even cheaper than taking the subway, or a regular taxi, but I can’t bring myself to wait 12 minutes for a drive that’s shorter than that. So I took the subway, and was home by the time the driver was supposed to pick me up. I guess they’re still staffing the thing, not enough drivers, but that’s a bummer.</p></div>

And they do know how to make a burger! I can vouch for the black pepper one, but a lot of the other ones left me undecided when it was time to pick one. You can get them in regular size or mini-burger, which might be big enough for a snack. The fries are delicious, and there’s a jar (really) of chocolate mousse for dessert.</p>

There’s always a huge line outside. This line will take you to a very small counter, where they will hand you the thing. You will have to wait. Sometimes you will have to wait a lot. If you go inside and find a seat, and a seat you will find as they have a maze-like interior that seats a lot of people, a waiter will come to you, usually as soon as you sit down, and take your order. Do yourself a favor, order a couple, and don’t forget the chocolate milk. You can also get some to take away, and you’ll leave while the others are still waiting outside.</p>

As soon as I got to the Jerónimos Monastery I realised my plans had to be changed, as most of the stuff I wished to visit was closed for the day.

That got me thinking, a bit more, and I got the xpro1. That’s that.</p>

Took the chance to try out the new (as in new-in-my-hands) Fuji x-Pro1. I knew, from the moment i handled it the first time, that we were going to get along just fine. But I was still afraid to leave the 5dmkii behind.<br>I can tell you i’m not afraid. Not anymore.</p>

Most of the lenses, by the way, would get little use. I’m ready to announce that I’m in love with the 23/1.4 and, as soon as I shot the first frame with it, I knew I was set.</p>

</div></figure><p name="f731" id="f731" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Most of the trip was shot with it, and I found it perfect for the kind of thing we were doing, walking and walking some more, getting in and out of castles, bus ride, shops, churches and markets, hotels and restaurants, with very limited time on each stop. No time to look around for too long, just pick something and shoot. The lens came through all day long, on dark places, darker places, and places with no light at all. It was really a joy to see how well it performed on those conditions.</p>

</div></figure><p name="8799" id="8799" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">We were not that lucky with the weather, but that was cool too, I can now tell you the camera operates nicely around the zero mark on thermometers. Battery life, though, sucks biiiiiiiig time. I cannot remember the last time I had to change batteries midday with the Canon, but this Fuji thingy needs a lot of feeding, two batteries a day for the kind of days I was having. I do rely on the electronic viewfinder a lot, but still… I’m getting a third battery before the next trip.</p>
